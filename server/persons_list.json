                "abstract": "This report describes the results of a workshop on research data management (RDM) that took place in June 2019. More than 50 experts from 46 different non-university institutes covering all Leibniz Sections participated. The aim of the workshop was the intra- and transdisciplinary exchange among RDM experts of different institutions and sections within the Leibniz Association on current questions and challenges but also on experiences and activities with respect to RDM. The event was structured in inspiring talks, a World Caf\u00e9 to discuss ideas and solutions related to RDM and an exchange of experts following their affiliation to the different Leibniz sections. The workshop revealed that most institutions, independent of scientific fields, face similar overarching problems with respect to RDM, e.g. missing incentives and no awareness of the benefits that would arise from a proper RDM and data sharing. The event also endorsed that the Research Data Working Group of the Leibniz Association (AK Forschungsdaten) is a place for the exchange of all topics around RDM and enables discussions on how to refine RDM at all institutions and in all scientific fields."

                "abstract": "How self-evident is a colonial rationality today? This paper begins by tracing a \u2018text trajectory\u2019 about nineteenth century imperialism and colonialism through several educational spaces: curricular guidelines, textbook, teachers\u2019 reflections on history education, material discursive classroom interactions and pupils\u2019 communication about the topic. In a first step, we observe how entrenched and common sensical a great-power discourse about imperialism and colonialism is in current educational practices. We suggest that pupils \u2018hyperstate\u2019 a discursive position on colonialism which appears shocking when stated explicitly, but which is already subtly entextualised in curricular and media discourse. However, in a second step, the analysis orients to the molecular lines and foldings, the unexpected intra-connections and unplanned \u2018lines of flight\u2019. In this way, the apparent stability of the colonial rationality begins to wobble (just slightly). The memory practices enacted by pupils, curricula, teachers, authors and the material affordances of textbooks repeat entrenched colonial hierarchies and racisms, \u2018and also\u2019 exceed any overly simple understanding of how colonial rationality plays out in contemporary discourse.<br/><br/>"

This essay examines the extent to which educational films of this period employed a range of techniques to reach their viewers and encouraged them to take the film\u2019s argumentation on board. Categorizing these techniques as either narrative strategies or visual effects, we contextualize their use by taking the film Die Weltgeschichte als Kolonialgeschichte (\u201cWorld History as Colonial History,\u201d 1926) as an example."

This study asks how contemporary European education policies and curricula frame digital learning in schools, with particular attention to history education. It investigates digital strategies, media education concepts, core curricula, and history and IT-related curricula, which collectively shape the requirements, guidelines and expectations for the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in history lessons. In addition to analysing European Union policy, the study includes case studies of seven European countries (Albania, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain)."

The book maps and discusses approaches based in cultural studies as well as in the social and educational sciences in addition to contemporary methodologies used in the field. The book aims to become the central interdisciplinary reference for textbook researchers, students, and educational practitioners."

Their content, design, and educational aims and objectives have changed over time, as have the manner of their production, their role in the classroom, and the ways in which their users acquire the knowledge canonised in them. Today\u2019s textbooks coexist or compete with other forms of educational media and are themselves undergoing a process of transformation in the wake of the digital revolution. These developments notwithstanding, research shows that textbooks remain the most important educational medium in schools worldwide, created in negotiation processes at the societal level and delivering the knowledge these societies deem relevant enough to pass on to the younger generation."

The chapter concludes by offering up new potential directions for theoretical and methodological approaches in future textbook studies. These suggestions aside others include the fusion of differing theoretical perspectives, more interdisciplinary work, and multimodal approaches as well as the need to focus on visual and digital educational media. Future textbook studies are to adopt its methodological and theoretical repertoires to keep up to the challenges that come along with the digitalisation of textbooks."

First, it summarises the theories, methods and substantive issues which the preceding chapters in the Handbook identify as leading the field of textbook studies today. Second, again in close dialogue with the Handbook\u2019s other chapters and their findings, it points to extant gaps in the research. Third, reflecting critically on the Handbook\u2019s structural limitations, it identifies topics and issues to which future textbook research could devote itself beyond the foci presented in its chapters. The chapter concludes that textbook studies has evolved into an interdisciplinary field of research which has succeeded in applying, modifying and further developing theories and methods from the social sciences and cultural studies."

Die Argumentation folgt dabei einem Dreischritt mit Blick auf Diskurs, Institution und Praktiken: Zun\u00e4chst diskutieren wir, was Teilen in der Debatte \u00fcber OER bedeutet und welche gesellschaftspolitischen Forderungen mit dem Verst\u00e4ndnis <br/>einer Kultur des Teilens verkn\u00fcpft sind. Dann beschreiben wir aus schultheoretischer Perspektive die Funktionen der Institution Schule und identifizieren dabei das Leistungs- und das Gemeinschaftsprinzip als analytische Linsen. Diese dienen uns im dritten Schritt zur Untersuchung  von  Praktiken  des  Teilens  im  Klassenraum  am  Beispiel  einer  Unterrichtsbeobachtung.  Als  Ergebnis  arbeiten  wir  heraus,  dass  das  Verst\u00e4ndnis  des  Begriffes  \u2039Teilen\u203a in der Schule und im OER-Diskurs trotz inhaltlicher \u00dcberschneidungen differiert.

The article argues that schools, embedded as they are in a societies undergoing a digital change and experiencing concomitant change in the skills and competencies required of their members, bear a responsibility for teaching digital media practices in the classroom. The article focuses on the \u2018digital revolution of textbooks\u2019 and how it demands the transformation of former school textbooks into digital educational media. Furthermore, the text pinpoints what is inhibiting this \u2018revolution\u2019 by taking a look at the current debate concerning challenges and opportunities of Open Educational Resources (OER). By describing the contemporary trends concerning digital textbooks and OER as well as looking at contemporary pilot projects, which already break new ground for OER production, the article will discuss future challenges for producers, distributors, and users of digital educational media."

Drawing on ethnographically oriented research at German Schools Abroad, this paper teases out three sets of practices regarding young  people\u2019s  mobile  media  use:  \u00absafe\u00bb,  \u00abenthusiastic\u00bb,  and  \u00abpostdigital\u00bb.  Presenting  vignettes  from  three  schools  to  illustrate  each  set  of  practices,  the  paper  demonstrates  how  students  are  differently  controlled,  guided,  and  given  space  to  shape  their  worlds  through  the  practices.  The  paper  highlights  that  these  practices  exist  simultaneously.  <br/>They enact different (not better or worse) institutional priorities and different (not better or  worse)  understandings  of  young  people\u2019s  mobile  use.  The  paper  also  highlights  the  tensions  when  schools  aim  to  control  young  people\u2019s  mobile  use,  arguing  that  each  set  of practices undermines itself. It ends by reflecting on the implications for future research and  practice  if  we  see  increased  mobile  media  use  in  schools  not,  as  often  assumed,  <br/>as  a  mark  of  \u00abprogress\u00bb,  \u00abimprovement\u00bb  or  \u00abmodernity\u00bb,  but  instead  as  emerging  from  different understandings of school and young people"

                "abstract": "This article examines Austrian, British, French and German newsreels and European information films produced in the period from 1948 to 1958 either by private and semi-private newsreel companies or transnational, supranational and national institutions like the Economic Cooperation Administration, Council of Europe, European Coal and Steel Community. These newsreel items and short films are not only records from the beginning and consolidation of the European integration project but also political instruments in this process. On the one hand, they informed the public about the new institutions, their purposes as well as their decision-making procedures; on the other hand, they were intended to create a European identity by rewriting a collective cultural and historical memory. By means of these films, some of them being part of the public relations campaigns of various European institutions and newsreel companies, a consistent picture of \u2018Europe\u2019 was shaped. This audiovisual representation of Europe as a geographical and historical entity, or, respectively, \u2018the idea of European integration\u2019, was not only a result of a political discourse but also a cultural continuation of a centuries-old iconographic tradition. This article aims at broadening the academic debate on a European identity by analysing the political communication process of the European Integration in the 1950s."

Among the most important technologies emerging today are data-aggregating technologies such as AI, affective computing, adaptive or predictive software, clouds and platforms. The paper is not, however, directed at specific technologies, but at indeterminate sociotechnical configurations. Set in 2040, it offers three \u2018histories\u2019 of the 2020s. Might students become (i) \u2018smooth users\u2019, improving themselves in the pursuit of frictionless efficiency within a post-democratic frame created by large corporations, (ii) \u2018digital nomads\u2019, seeking freedom, individualism and aesthetic joy as solopreneurs exploiting state regulations and algorithmic rules while stepping out of the state and deeply into the capitalist new economy, or (iii) participatory, democratic, ecological humans embedded in \u2018collective agency\u2019 that see institutions as spaces for exploring more equitable ways of living? The paper reflects on the future research and the political, educational and technological decisions which would make each of these three fictional future histories more or less likely."

The so-called spatial turn within the social sciences and humanities has exposed transnational, postcolonial and global aspects of identity constructions beyond the narrow borders of the nation and all things national. Stimulating historical and geographical research into nations and identities, this journal is informed by the same epistemology, tentatively located in postmodern thinking. Despite the prophecies of doom of postmodern enthusiasts, this study testifies to the continued relevance of borders and national attachments, albeit in terms of self-reflexivity."

These include the historicisation, comparison, and deconstruction of national narratives, images, and semantics with which knowledge of nations is generated but also recognition of the contingency and political expediency of textbooks as carriers of such knowledge. The works quoted in this chapter have been selected by virtue of the breadth of the approaches they adopt, which range from explicit theoretical conceptualisations of nationhood in textbooks to the assumption that nations provide a legitimate framework of reference\u2014an assumption which effectively predicates the epistemic validity of this concept."

Globalization is understood in this approach as referring to: (1) a cognitive shift; (2) expanding relevancy spaces; and (3) new forms of subjectivation. The framework is illustrated with examples from educational policy and learning materials, with an extended look at how globalization is articulated in recent shifts in Holocaust education."

It explores history education as a media- saturated cultural site in which particular social orderings and categorizations emerge as commonsensical and others are contested. Describing vignettes from ethnographic fieldwork in German secondary schools, this article identifies different memory practices as a nexus of pupils, teachers, blackboards, pens, textbooks, and online videos that enacts what counts as worth remembering today: reproduction; destabilization without explicit contestation; and interruption. Exploring mediated memory practices thus highlights an array of (often unintended) ways of making the past present.<br/>"

They are increasingly shaped by ambivalence. Against this backdrop, she analyses how history teachers from Germany and Switzerland interpret and evaluate an ambivalent and thus rather typical quote from a German textbook about the origins of the Cold War. She presents three intriguing findings: (i) The interpretations of the quote offered by the teachers differ greatly from one another as they read the same lines rather differently. These differences partly follow a national logic. Whereas the Swiss teachers argue mostly in line with the traditionalist concept of a morally superior USA and a dictatorial Soviet Union, German teachers are much more divided among themselves with some adhering to revisionist, others to traditionalist interpretations. (ii) Especially among German teachers leaning towards revisionist positions, we find clear differences between those trained in the former East and West Germanys. Whereas the western German teachers tend to direct moral criticism towards the USA, their eastern German colleagues criticise moralising views on history and normalise Soviet expansionism. (iii) Teachers from all three countries share the assumption that their way of reading the quote and interpreting the origin of the Cold war is without any alternative. They thus all contribute to the construction of the illusion of hegemony. Discussing her empirical findings in the light of competing theoretical considerations about the social function of ambivalence, Christophe argues that a productive engagement with ambivalence is hampered by this illusion of hegemony."

From a theoretical perspective her analysis is inspired by memory studies; methodologically she draws on a discourse-based frame analysis. Focussing on rich points, on moments when something unexpected is of particular relevance to processes of framing and interaction, the paper raises three questions. It explores (i) to what extent frames offered by the teachers are shared or contested, (ii) how coherent these frames are and (iii) how frames established by teachers and students interact. Christophe arrives at three conclusions: (i) She shows that both teachers mobilise two clearly recognisable though opposing frames, both of which have political implications. (ii) She also demonstrates that they stretch and bend their preferred frames in order to integrate all the details they want to mention. (iii) And she argues that students regularly miss the frames offered by their teachers by either failing to recognise their narrative and political logic or by tacitly resisting them. Discussing these empirical insights against the backdrop of debates in memory studies and history didactics, Christophe argues that the misunderstandings we can observe when teachers and students negotiate the meaning of the past as representatives of different generations appear  to  be  an  important  third  pattern  in  communication  about  memory  beyond  the"

Covering a broad range of cultural contexts and applying a diverse set of methodological strategies, they map the dividing lines in and between memory cultures in the crisis-driven and volatile age of our present in which mnemonic consensus is clearly an issue of the past \u2013 if indeed it has ever existed at all. Authors analysing educational media point to varying degrees of ambivalence, vagueness and contradictions in the inescapably political textbook narratives understood to be echoes of societal and academic controversies. Authors focussing on teachers and the history classroom show how unresolved political issues create tensions and dilemmas in history education. They render visible how teachers struggle to handle these challenges by pretending that what they do is \u2018just history\u2019. Obfuscating the political that is inherent to all memory practices, they produce the illusion that the history in which they are engaged is all about addressing the past with a reflexive and disciplined approach."

Third, reflecting critically on the Handbook\u2019s structural limitations, it identifies topics and issues to which future textbook research could devote itself beyond the foci presented in its chapters. The chapter concludes that textbook studies has evolved into an interdisciplinary field of research which has succeeded in applying, modifying and further developing theories and methods from the social sciences and cultural studies."

                "abstract": "Over 25 years after the fall of socialism, the memory of this period in European history continues to oscillate between nostalgia and opprobrium. For textbooks, as educational media and carriers of cultures of memory, this state of disagreement amounts to both a challenge and an opportunity to reflect societal debates around the issue. In their overview of current work on the depiction of socialism in textbooks, the authors uncover the theoretical assumptions and methodological approaches underlying this research and point the reader towards innovative work which ventures beyond simple analysis of textbooks\u2019 shortcomings in this regard. This chapter reveals a preponderance of research on Germany and post-Soviet countries and casts light on the heterogeneity of the theoretical premises and findings of work in this area."

The analysed lessons were delivered in Germany and Switzerland. Framework analysis shows that both teachers identified very different events as relevant and offered contrasting assessments of the moral qualities of the USA and the USSR. The teachers also left alternative interpretations unmentioned, and thus rendered invisible the political and moral concepts underlying their selection of teaching materials. Focusing on particularly dense moments of interaction, the paper subsequently analyses how pupils respond to such framings. It becomes evident that pupils barely recognise the offered framings. Taken together, classroom observations support the conclusion that transparency and reflexivity in dealing with the political dimension of historical narration are not only precepts of a fair culture of remembrance in present-day plural societies. They are also indispensable to enabling purely cognitive understanding."

Most of research works focus on a limited set of users, characterized by the same kind of main activities, e.g., researchers, or exploit external knowledge, such as predefined ontologies. An heterogeneous environment, with possible lack of information, and not well structured data, puts forward new challenges, to address the problem of adapting user profiling and consequently expert search. In this paper, we present a first attempt to create an expert search system to support users (such as researchers, students, authors) in finding experts to get in contact or to start a cooperation with in the field of textbook research. Hereby we semantically enrich user profiles building a Community Knowledge Graph (CKG) which defines relationships among users and related items. Furthermore, we present first experimental results that base on real users."

While users are typing their queries a \u201cmeaning-oriented\" analysis of each keystroke can provide different disambiguation suggestions (spelling correction, Named-Entity Recognition, WordNet- and Wikipedia-based suggestions) that can help users in formulating their queries for filtering relevant results. On the other hand systems can better interpret the query, because users implicitly tag the queries with the related meaning choosing the desired concept they had in mind. After the presentation of our architecture we show the results of two user studies, where users were asked to judge the support while typing their query and browsing documents. These results confirm that a semantic support is important in both cases."

                "abstract": "The  purpose of this article  is to  introduce  the  Lean Six Sigma (LSS)  DMAIC  (Define,  Measure,  Analyze,  Improve,  Control) roadmap  for  quality  assurance  in  biomedical  ontologies, by applying  Lean  Six  Sigma  principles  to  Ontology  Engineering and Collaboration Engineering. Collaboration lies at the human core of social processes and interactions, where a shared goal is <br/>what  participants  join  efforts  to  achieve;  therefore,  combining <br/>Collaboration   Engineering   and   LSS,   and,   specifically,   the DMAIC  route  which  structures  each  LSS  project  aims  at creating an applicable standard for quality assurance. That will help establish  effective  biomedical  interfunctional  databases that  can  help  to  improve  health  care  processes,  answering  the need  to  reduce  the  amount  of  human  errors  associated  with inefficient health care processes. <br/>The   research   idea   suggested   within   this   paper   aims   at developing  ontologies  that  are  functional  to  meet  health  care needs,  by  ensuring  data  collection  reliability,  by  creating  a common  language  to  speak  with  data,  and  by  promoting  a shared  culture  of  process  optimization  and  cost  effectiveness. Semantic approaches for Collaboration Engineering have been debated   in   previous   works,   where   a   new   ontology-based approach has been suggested, where collaboration knowledge is collected,  managed  and  shared  by  connecting  each  concept  of an ontology to a more detailed collaboration step or a resource, by applying LSS principles. <br/>The originality of this article lies in introducing LSS DMAIC as an  effective  and  efficient  scientific  methodology  to  query  and feed ontologies, and as a tool for quality assurance, which meets the   need   for   shared   knowledge,   providing   solutions   to interfunctional  problems  applying  to  people  with  different competences.

Therefore, the challenge is to create a bridge between Linked Open Data (LOD) and the Component MetaData Infrastructure (CMDI) to ensure that the limits of the two paradigms are compensated and strengthened to create a new hybrid approach. While on the one hand, CMDI is easier to use for modelling purposes, the Metadata is not descriptive enough for a document to be easily discoverable using Linked Data (LD) technologies to publish and to enrich the document\u2019s content. Yet on the other hand, the explicit semantics and high interoperability of LOD have many advantages, but its modelling process is too complex for non-expert users. Here we show how knowledge organization plays a crucial role in this issue."

Current solutions (commercial or free) do not provide users with easy access to data, nor tools for analysing and displaying data. In this paper, we discuss the potential of the DAF (Data Analytics Framework), a project based on big data, which was created by the Italian government in 2017 and which fosters the integration and standardisation of data, as well as providing three powerful tools for analysis and data visualisation. The paper will then illustrate a concrete case of dashboard development within the DAF, released at an important hackathon organised by the Italian PA sector in October 2017. The project serves as a use case in DAF implementation, where its analytical tools are used for data analysis &amp; visualisation. They also translate a large amount of data into simple representations and use clear and effective language. "

                "abstract": "Recommendation refers to the automatic process of discovering and suggesting new but relevant  items to users, according to the preferences inferred from their previous activity. But, not only the items or their content are related to the user preferences but also the context in which the user have consumed the items. In this regard, the so -called context- aware recommenders refer to the systems in-tegrating such contextual information in the recommendation process. However, sometimes it is not clear what context information is the best in order to improve the recommendation process or how it should be included. In this sense, we present a novel approach for context - aware recommendation based on a conceptual modelling for the user-item - context matrix. The modelling is conducted by means of the application of Formal Concept Analysis(FCA) to infer and organize the user preferences derived from their previous contextualized activity. We have experimented with different ways to integrate the contextual information by splitting it in the different dimensions that it addresses (e.g. location, time, company...). To that end, we have proposed different recommendation algorithms (content \u2013 based, collaborative filtering and hybrid recommenders)and also different ways to manage the user\u2019s ratings. The obtained results prove the suitability of FCA for context-aware recommendation, outperforming other state of-the-art proposals.<br/>"

These systems are broadly used in several fields and applications, being common that an user interact with several recommender systems during his daily activities. However, most of these systems are black boxes which users really don\u2019t understand how to work. This lack of transparency often causes the distrust of the users. A suitable solution is to offer explanations to the user about why the system is offering such recommendations. This work deals with the problem of retrieving and evaluating explanations based on hybrid recommenders. These explanations are meant to improve the perceived recommendation quality from the user\u2019s perspective. Along with recommended items, explanations are presented to the user to underline the quality of the recommendation. Hybrid recommenders should express relevance by providing reasons speaking for a recommended item. In this work we present an attribute explanation retrieval approach to provide these reasons and show how to evaluate such approaches. Therefore, we set up an online user study where users were asked to provide movie feedback. For each rated movie we additionally retrieved feedback about the reasons this movie was liked or disliked. With this data, explanation retrieval can be studied in general, but it can also be used to evaluate such explanations."

For the entity linking task, our system uses disambiguation features that are based on KB information as well as on semantic similarity relations between named entities identified in the document context and in KB entries. To solve the NIL clustering task we implemented a three-stage approach which aims to improve upon an initial name mention string similarity clustering by introducing separate clustering steps for ambiguity and synonymy resolution. We describe implementation details of our system, and present a preliminary analysis of the results."

In this paper we analyze the social graph and the user's interactions in the form of posts and group memberships to model user interests and fields of expertise. The proposed model reflects expertise and interests of users based on experimental analysis of the explicit and implicit social data in Online Social Networks (OSNs). It employs social networks analysis, text mining, text classification, and semantic text similarity techniques to analyze and discover the latent semantic social graph model that can express user's expertise. The proposed model also considers the semantic similarity between user's posts and his groups, Influence of friendship on group's membership, and Influence of friendship on user's posts.

In a graph, a link prediction function of two vertices denotes the similarity or proximity of the vertices. Common link prediction functions for general graphs are defined using paths of length two between two nodes. Since in a bipartite graph adjacency vertices can only be connected by paths of odd lengths, these functions do not apply to bipartite graphs. Instead, a certain class of graph kernels (spectral transformation kernels) can be generalized to bipartite graphs when the positive-semidefinite kernel constraint is relaxed. This generalization is realized by the odd component of the underlying spectral transformation. This construction leads to several new link prediction pseudokernels such as the matrix hyperbolic sine, which we examine for rating graphs, authorship graphs, folksonomies, document-feature networks and other types of bipartite networks.<br/>"

Classical methods of crawling data from SL lead to irrelevant data content because of the dynamic nature of avatars and objects in SL. In order to build artificially intelligent expert avatar agents that are able to provide intelligent services for other typical avatars in virtual world we attempt to en-hance the quality of extracted data from SL. Based on experimental observation, avatars tend to gather in some places for different amounts of time, which forms tempo-ral and spatial hotspots. Utilizing the Tempo-Spatial char-acteristics of the avatars behavior in virtual worlds could improve the quality of the extracted data. Smart-TSH-Finder implements a Tempo-Spatial Hotspots finding mechanism to crawl dynamic contents such as chat con-versations from Second Life. The system introduces two mechanisms: the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Detection, and the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Prediction. Our smart chat conversations that have been crawled showed good en-hancement in content quality of the crawled chat conver-sation which will enrich the future textual analysis work. Additionally, we found that extracting avatars interactions and behavior in the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots in addition to chat conversations can help in generation a more coherent social network model for SL."

Current approaches for the named entity disambiguation are usually based on exploiting structured semantic and lingual re-sources (e.g. WordNet, DBpedia). Unfortu-nately, each of these resources cover indepen-dently from each other insufficient information for the task of named entity disambiguation. On the one hand WordNet comprises a relative small number of named entities while on the other hand DBpedia provides only little context for named entities. Our approach is based on the use of multi-lingual Wikipedia data. We show how the combination of multi-lingual resources can be used for named entity disambiguation. Based on a German and an English document corpus, we evaluate various similarity measures and algo-rithms for extracting data for named entity dis-ambiguation. We show that the intelligent filter-ing of context data and the combination of multi-lingual information provides high quality named entity disambiguation results."

However, there are many challenges to achieve these goals, such as finding experts that can interactively answer a given query, and matching the virtual and real identity of that given experts. In this paper, we study these issues and propose a framework for virtual e-learning solutions to integrate an expert avatar service to Virtual Worlde-learning environments to enrich those environments with one of the most important real learning futures, which is the ability to ask experts and get instant feedback. In our proposed solution, we implemented a web services based expert finding system for 3D virtual worlds to automatically identify the most qualified resident (expert avatar) to answer a given query. The nature of the proposed system as Web services architecture will increase scalability by allowing other virtual worlds to integrate with. Virtual e-learning environments will have great interest in the proposed solution, since it will on one hand improve the interactivity of users and on the other hand open opportunities to facilitate exchange of information between e-learning users.

Drawing on Collaboration Engineering and the logical model, the paper explores the use of an ontology to capture and share knowledge about collaboration. As a result, we present a collaboration ontology that builds a common vocabulary for the key concepts of collaboration and the relations and dependencies between them.

                "abstract": "Current search engines (e.g. Google, Yahoo) are used for retrieving relevant documents from the huge amount of data available and have become an essential tool for the majority of Web users. Standard search engines do not consider semantic information that can help in recognizing the relevance of a document with respect to the meaning of a query. Furthermore, most of them only support one language. However, users speaking several languages would, in principle, be able to switch to another language if the results of their original query are unsatisfactory. This thesis provides a new semantic-based search approach to Web search. Unlike the \u201cstandard\u201d search process, users are redirected to semantic concepts that could describe their query. This semantic-based redirection serves to support the search process by providing possible meanings of the query words and assigning the retrieved documents to the respective meanings. In this thesis, lexical resources are used for providing the possible meanings of query words and the related translations in the languages the users are able to speak. The contexts of the query words are recognized using Word Sense Disambiguation approaches. Semantically similar documents are grouped together using Document Categorization techniques. Moreover, Semantic and Multilingual Text Retrieval methods are developed to support humans in filtering and retrieving relevant documents. Additionally, in order to assist users in the semantic-based multilingual search process, pre-processing approaches such as named-entity recognition, spell checking and stemming methods are applied to queries and documents. All the proposed methods are compared and evaluated. Several tools that implement combinations of these methods have been developed and discussed."

This system therefore provides a platform for evaluating the usefulness of different retrieval support methods and their combination."

The system currently supports two types of annota- tions: Categorization based on information extracted from user bookmarks (In- telligent Bookmarks) and semantic disambiguation of query terms in docu- ments using an ontology that can be selected by the user (Sense Folders). We describe both approaches and present adaptive user interfaces for different de- vices (mobile and desktop) that use these services in order to improve the user's search process. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages of dividing query re- sults set processing (the information to be presented) from the interface design (information presentation) using web services in order to simplify the develop- ment of retrieval systems for, e.g., different desktop as well as mobile devices."

While users are typing their queries a \u201cmeaning-oriented\u201d analysis of each keystroke can provide different disambiguation suggestions (spelling correction, Named-Entity Recognition, WordNet- and Wikipedia-based suggestions) that can help users in formulating their queries for filtering relevant results. On the other hand systems can better interpret the query, because users implicitly tag the queries with the related meaning choosing the desired concept they had in mind. After the presentation of our architecture we show the results of two user studies, where users were asked to judge the support while typing their query and browsing documents. These results confirm that a semantic support is important in both cases."

Its high research output and methodological plurality stands in contrast to its low institutional basis in universities and other academic institutions. The main deficit of the current literature of textbook-related research is the lack of empirical findings on the usage, reception, and effects of textbooks in the classroom and a widespread atheoretical approach to textbook analysis. However, the field is expanding which is reflected by a variety of research approaches conducted from different disciplinary perspectives"

It will focus on the early 1990s, due to the fact that, at the end of the 1980s, both institutions found themselves facing crises which led to profound and far-reaching processes of reform, which in their turn engendered a rapprochement and, eventually, cooperation between the two institutions. After providing brief overviews of the development of both ISCHE and Paedagogica Historica up to and into the 1980s, the article will concentrate in its third part on the long-lasting \u2013 commencing after ISCHE\u2019s foundation in 1979 \u2013 and multi-faceted relationship between the two, both of which made significant contributions to the emergence of an international academic community of those working in history of education. The article will additionally explore the range of strategies used by the two institutions in relation to the publication of findings in the field and the institutional practices of cooperation with and demarcation from one another exercised by ISCHE and Paedagogica Historica."

Allerdings vollzieht sich gegenw\u00e4rtig ein paradigmatischer Wechsel, der das nationale Paradigma nicht aufl\u00f6st, aber in eine neue Perspektive stellt. Nationalgeschichte oszilliert damit zunehmend zwischen einer europ\u00e4ischen oder globalen Perspektive einerseits und regionalen Ausdifferenzierungen andererseits.<br/>Der hier vorliegende Band nimmt diesen Trend auf, indem er erstmals in vergleichender Perspektive die regionale Ebene in das Zentrum bildungs-geschichtlicher Analysen stellt und dabei \u00fcber Preu\u00dfen als allgemeinen Referenzpunkt hinausgeht.<br/>Die Beitr\u00e4ge thematisieren nicht nur das Verh\u00e4ltnis von Reich und L\u00e4ndern, sondern auch die regionalspezifischen Auspr\u00e4gungen und interregionalen Transferprozesse im Bildungsbereich im 19. Jahrhundert. "

Cutting-edge essays by leading experts and emerging scholars explore the field\u2019s theories, methodologies, and topics with the goal of generating debate and providing new perspectives. The Georg Eckert Institute\u2019s unique transdisciplinary focus on international textbook research has shaped this handbook, which explores the history of the discipline, the production processes and contexts that influence textbooks, the concepts they incorporate, how this medium itself is received and future trends. The book maps and discusses approaches based in cultural studies as well as in the social and educational sciences in addition to contemporary methodologies used in the field. The book aims to become the central interdisciplinary reference for textbook researchers, students, and educational practitioners."

Their content, design, and educational aims and objectives have changed over time, as have the manner of their production, their role in the classroom, and the ways in which their users acquire the knowledge canonised in them. Today\u2019s textbooks coexist or compete with other forms of educational media and are themselves undergoing a process of transformation in the wake of the digital revolution. These developments notwithstanding, research shows that textbooks remain the most important educational medium in schools worldwide, created in negotiation processes at the societal level and delivering the knowledge these societies deem relevant enough to pass on to the younger generation."

First, it summarises the theories, methods and substantive issues which the preceding chapters in the Handbook identify as leading the field of textbook studies today. Second, again in close dialogue with the Handbook\u2019s other chapters and their findings, it points to extant gaps in the research. Third, reflecting critically on the Handbook\u2019s structural limitations, it identifies topics and issues to which future textbook research could devote itself beyond the foci presented in its chapters. The chapter concludes that textbook studies has evolved into an interdisciplinary field of research which has succeeded in applying, modifying and further developing theories and methods from the social sciences and cultural studies."

It has long been established that history textbooks play a key role in shaping the next generation\u2019s understanding of both past events and the concept of \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018foe\u2019. Considering both current and historical textbooks, often through a bi-national comparative approach, the editors and contributors investigate various important aspects of the relationships between textbooks and war, including the role wars play in the creation of national identities (whether the country is on the winning or losing side), the effacement of international wars to highlight a country\u2019s exceptionalism, or the obscuring of intra-national conflict through the ways in which a civil war is portrayed. This pioneering book will be of interest and value to students and scholars of textbooks, educational media and the relationships between curricula and war."

Auf Basis dieser These sp\u00fcrt der Artikel der Auswahlpraxis in den deutschen Bundesl\u00e4ndern nach. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf Beteiligung von Sch\u00fclern an den Entscheidungen, die zur Einf\u00fchrung eines Schulbuches f\u00fchren. Dabei werden zum einen gesetzliche Bestimmungen der Landesschulgesetze betrachtet, bevor in einem zweiten Schritt einige Beispiele aus der Praxis an einzelnen Schulen vorgestellt werden. Aus diesen Erkenntnissen werden die Anbieter-Kundenbeziehungen mit Ber\u00fccksichtigung dreier Kundengruppen (Lehrer, Eltern, Sch\u00fcler) modelliert. Anhand dieses Modells diskutiert der Artikel Probleme, die aus der Vernachl\u00e4ssigung der Bed\u00fcrfnisse der Kundengruppe Sch\u00fcler entstehen k\u00f6nnen. So kann es durch von wenigen Lehrern getroffene Kollektiventscheidungen zu sub-optimalen Ergebnissen kommen, die letztlich eine Entfremdung der Sch\u00fcler vom Schulbuch zur Folge haben k\u00f6nnen. Der Artikel schl\u00e4gt eine st\u00e4rkere Einbindung der Sch\u00fcler in den Auswahlprozess vor. So k\u00f6nnte eine \u201eSchulbuchalphabetisierung\u201c und eine positivere Einstellung zum Medium und letztlich auch zum Lernen erreicht werden."

Therefore a data middleware is to be implemented to enable integration and standardization of the various GEI data existing in diverse forms as well embed it in a broader semantic context, thus enabling \u201cWorld Views\u201d."

Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist die Vertiefung des empirischen Verst\u00e4ndnisses der spezifischen Informationsbed\u00fcrfnisse von Archivnutzern und damit die Leistung eines grundlegenden Beitrags zur Verbesserung von archivischen Informationssystemen. Dazu untersucht die prim\u00e4re Forschungsfrage die M\u00f6glichkeit der Erarbeitung einer Ontologie, die in angemessener Weise das Erkenntnisinteresse von Nutzern an Archive repr\u00e4sentiert, und auf formale Anfragen, ad\u00e4quate Antworten erzeugt. Zu diesem Zweck analysiert die Studie schriftliche Nutzeranfragen an das Bundesarchiv und das Nationalarchiv von Norwegen (Arkivverket). Die prim\u00e4ren Forschungsergebnisse umfassen einen methodischen Ansatz, der eine interpretative Analyse schriftlich formulierter Fragen an Archive vertritt und, als Ergebnis seiner erfolgreichen Anwendung, das Archival Knowledge Model (AKM) erarbeitet. Das AKM ist eine ontologische Repr\u00e4sentation des Gegenstandbereichs, der typischerweise als das Erkenntnisinteresse von Fragen an Archiven erscheint. Die Studie zeigt, dass derartige Anfragen dominante, grundlegende ontologische Muster aufweisen, die auf einen relativ kleinen Satz ontologischer Entit\u00e4ten formalisiert werden k\u00f6nnen. Das AKM repr\u00e4sentiert damit formal und explizit die Informationsbed\u00fcrfnisse von Archivnutzern in Form einer Ontologie. Diese stellt ein konstitutives Modell f\u00fcr die Evaluierung bestehender Archivinformationssysteme und Datenschemata zur Verf\u00fcgung und kann die Entwicklung neuer Katalogisierungsregeln oder musterbasierter Abfrageanwendungen unterst\u00fctzen."

                "abstract": "This study addresses the question why intergroup conflicts over scarce, renewable resources in peripheral areas of the global South escalate into violence. In order to do so, twenty cases of such conflicts, seven of which turned violence, are analyzed. The method of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis is used in order to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative accounts in the field and to detect patterns of conjunctural causation. In theoretical terms, structural conditions (negative othering and high power differences between the conflict parties) and triggering conditions (external resource appropriation and recent political change) of a violent escalation of renewable resource conflicts are distinguished. The empirical results as well as various robustness checks and comparisons with individual cases suggest that the simultaneous presence of negative othering, low power differences and recent political change is a sufficient condition for the violent escalation of conflicts over scarce renewable resources. I conclude that research on socio-environmental conflicts should pay more attention to conjunctural causation, local power differences and qualitatively different forms of conflict and political change."

                "abstract": "Biofuels have been the subject of heated political discussions, but also of a growing literature on discourses and environmental policies. Previous studies on the issue have, however, neglected the fact that the different discourses about on biofuels are increasingly crossing national boundaries, i.e., that there is a tendency toward transnationalization. In the light of this development the present article analyzes the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse in the period 2005-2011 with a special emphasis on actors from Brazil, the EU and the USA. By conducting a discourse analysis along the lines of Hajer, five discourse coalitions can be distinguished, each providing a different view on the opportunities, problems and perspectives of biofuel production in Brazil. It is observed that the long-established hegemony of the discourse coalition of biofuel supporters was successfully challenged by a more critical position during the food crisis of 2007/2008. As a result, the discourse coalition of critical supporters-which was committed to sustainable biofuel production via political regulation-prevailed in the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse and its position was translated into policy measures."

                "abstract": "This study explores the conceptual and empirical utility of studying school textbooks from a critical geopolitics perspective. School textbooks bind together various discourses, modalities and genres and can reflect the dominant knowledge in a given society. They therefore have a high potential to reveal the citational practices resonating between the domains of formal, practical and popular geopolitics. Studying school textbooks can also enrich the literature on children's and young people's (political) geographies by analyzing how the political worldviews and agency of young people are shaped by teaching materials. Empirically, the study draws on a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to study how environment-conflict links are textually and visually portrayed in German geography and civics textbooks. The results suggest that German school textbooks significantly reflect the depictions of environment-conflict links in political, media and (popular) science discourses and thus reveal crucial citational practices. Drawing on the environmental security literature, it is further argued that these textbooks convey problematic geographical imaginations: they overemphasize the risk of environmental conflicts, reflect ideas of spill-over effects threatening the global north, and portray people from the global south as irresponsible and threatening."

                "abstract": "The links between environmental degradation, renewable resource scarcity, and conflict are still poorly understood. One reason for this is the positivist\u2013rationalist bias which is characteristic of the mainstream literature on socio-environment conflicts but has largely remained unaddressed so far. Many studies are therefore unable to utilize insights from environmental sociology, constructivist conflict research, and political ecology. Drawing on this literature and discourse theory, the article develops a constructivist understanding of socio-environmental conflicts. The proposed framework highlights the relevance of discursively constructed identities, situation assessments, and interests for understanding the dynamics of such conflicts. The plausibility of the framework across different contexts is demonstrated by a discussion of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian water conflict and forest conflicts in northern Thailand."

                "abstract": "Adequate fresh water availability is an important factor for human security in many parts of the world. In transboundary river basins, decreased water supply due to local environmental change and global climate change and increased water demand due to growing populations and continued economic development can aggravate water scarcity. Contrary to the claim that water scarcity may result in an increased risk of armed conflict, there is no simple relationship between freshwater availability and violent conflict. Other crucial factors need to be taken into consideration that also directly influence resource availability and personal human well\u2010being. In this review, we assess the scientific literature on conflict and cooperation in transboundary river systems. Most international river basins are already jointly managed by the riparians, but successful management in times of climate change necessitates the inclusion of more factors besides mere allocation schemes. On the basis of a substantial body of literature on the management of transboundary watersheds, an analytical framework of the water\u2010security nexus is developed that integrates the physical and socioeconomic pathways connecting water availability with conflict or cooperation. This framework is subsequently applied to two transboundary river basins\u2014the Nile River and the Syr Darya/Amu Darya\u2014as they represent two world regions that could become future water hot spots. An improved understanding of the developments leading to water conflicts and their interaction can help to successfully reduce the risk of water conflicts in these regions and to move toward increased cooperation among the riparians of transboundary river systems"

                "abstract": "This study traces the (geopolitical) knowledge on terrorism circulating in Germany, India, Kenya, and the United States based on an analysis of school textbooks. It contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, it transcends the Western-centrism of International Relations by analysing discourses from the Global North and the Global South. Second, it introduces school textbooks as a crucial object of research in constructivist terrorism studies and International Relations. School textbooks indicate the (geopolitical) knowledge deemed essential in a given society, but are also widely distributed among young people. Third, I address the debate about a presumed homogenization and internationalization of terrorism discourses in recent years. Results show that all four discourses depict terrorists as evil, focus on external non-state groups as perpetrators and associate terrorism with Islam. But there are also considerable differences regarding the relative importance of terrorism as a security threat, the referent object affected and the countermeasures deemed appropriate."

                "abstract": "This article contributes to the literature on securitization in a twofold way. Firstly, it argues that school textbooks reveal the consolidated discursive realms of a given society and convey them to the next generation. Focusing on school textbooks can thus enrich the analysis of facilitating conditions for securitization processes. The second and main contribution of this article is that it addresses the lack of empirical studies on the audience in securitization research. After an analysis of climate change discourses in Germany, we test whether students exposed to vastly different positions of the same consolidated discursive realm are more prone to accept the securitization of climate change. In order to do so, we use a quasi-experimental research design and a closed questionnaire. Results show that young people who read school textbooks using an alarmist logic are indeed more likely to conceive climate change as an urgent threat necessitating extraordinary measures, and are thus more likely to accept the securitization of climate change."

However, resilience has rarely been applied in conjunction with the potentially complementary concept of environmental security. Therefore, this paper explores how the concepts of resilience and environmental security can be jointly applied by non-governmental organizations working to implement peacebuilding projects in developing countries. We first review definitions of the concepts and explore their strengths and pitfalls. Second, we develop a conceptual framework for a joint application whereby environmental security sharpens the scope of resilience, while resilience allows for taking issues into account that a traditional environmental security perspective might miss. Finally, we apply the conceptual framework to a case study from Palestine."

This study uses a cross-case, multi-method research design to test this proposition. More specifically, it argues that the conclusion of a cooperative environmental agreement can have a positive impact on reconciliation between rival states. Based on a new dataset on international rivalries, transboundary protected areas and international freshwater agreements, this study first conducts a statistical analysis and a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). The results are then verified and refined by six case studies. Triangulation of findings from all three methods suggests that the conclusion of a cooperative environmental agreement facilitates reconciliation in international rivalries. But this effect is contingent on a number of scope conditions, such as high environmental attention, internal political stability, wider patterns or traditions of environmental cooperation, and already ongoing processes of reconciliation."

                "abstract": "The literature on environmental peacemaking claims that groups in conflict can put aside their differences and cooperate in the face of shared environmental challenges, thereby facilitating more peaceful relations between them. This study provides the first comprehensive review of the widely dispersed empirical evidence on such environment-peace links. In order to do so, it distinguishes three understandings of peace and identifies four mechanisms connecting environmental cooperation to peace. The results suggest that environmental cooperation can facilitate the absence of violence within states as well as symbolic rapprochement within and between states, although such links are strongly dependent on the presence of several contextual factors. The most relevant mechanisms connecting environmental cooperation to peace are an increase in understanding and trust and especially the build-up of institutions. By contrast, environmental peacemaking is unlikely to have an impact on substantial integration between states or groups. Based on these findings, the article offers four suggestions for future research: (i) assess the relevance of environmental cooperation vis-\u00e0-vis other (presumably less context-dependent) drivers of peacemaking, (ii) pay more attention to the mechanisms connecting environmental cooperation to peacemaking, (iii) focus on the interactions between and the different time horizons of the three understandings of peace, and (iv) study the downside of environmental peacemaking to provide a more nuanced assessment and identify further relevant contextual factors."

                "abstract": "Critics have argued that the evidence of an association between climate change and conflict is flawed because the research relies on a dependent variable sampling strategy. Similarly, it has been hypothesized that convenience of access biases the sample of cases studied (\u2018streetlight effect\u2019). This also gives rise to claims that the climate-conflict literature stigmatizes some places as being more \u2018naturally\u2019 violent. Yet there has been no proof of such sampling patterns. Here we test whether climate-conflict research is based on such a biased sample through a systematic review of the literature. We demonstrate that research on climate change and violent conflict suffers from a streetlight effect. Further, small-N studies in particular are strongly informed by cases where there has been conflict, do not sample on the independent variables (climate impact or risk), and hence tend to find some association between these two variables. These biases mean that research on climate change and conflict primarily focuses on a few well accessible regions, overstates the links between both phenomena, and cannot explain peaceful outcomes from climate change. This could result in maladaptive responses in those places that are stigmatized as being inherently more prone to climate-induced violence."

By contrast, there are almost no such studies for the domain of education. This void is crucial as school attendance rates and the prevalence of environmental education are on the rise, while school education has privileged access to young people during their political socialisation. We address this void by analysing the depiction of water conflicts in school textbooks from a critical geopolitics perspective. More specifically, we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to analyse the visual and textual content of German geography textbooks published between 2000 and 2017. Our findings reveal that the analysed school textbooks securitise water and overstate the risk of water conflicts, which could yield a range of negative societal effects. The textbooks further reproduce Orientalist stereotypes about the Global South, and about the Middle East in particular, and often promote an uncritical green economy stance towards the privatisation of water. Water conflicts are hence discussed in the context of a crisis discourse and reproduce powerful knowledge that privileges certain political interests at the expense of others."

Recent research on both climate-conflict and climate-migration linkages has gained significant attention in the scientific and public debate. Both research fields are deeply intertwined and share some common characteristics. They also have been rapidly evolving during the past years with major achievements being made. Perhaps most importantly, an improved understanding of the role of (potential) climate change impacts in migration and conflicts has been achieved, which has been essential for moving beyond environmental determinism toward a more nuanced exploration of the interlinkages between climate, conflict and migration. Yet, significant conversations and uncertainties continue to exist, hence indicating the urgent need for further advances in these fields. Here, we debate cross-cutting and common pitfalls in both research fields and their implications for policy and research. These pitfalls include (i) insufficient attention to context factors and causal chains, (ii) underestimation of complex spatio-temporal patterns, (iii) discrepancies between quantitative and qualitative evidence, (iv) the non-consideration of adaptation strategies, and (v) a narrow spectrum of methods. We illustrate best practices and suggest ways to move the debate forward."

This void is unfortunate given the importance of education for peacebuilding and the wider \u201ceducational turn\u201d in human geography. This study represents the first systematic analysis of the role of education activities in the context of environmental peacebuilding. We establish a theoretical framework and analyse the education activities of three environmental peacebuilding projects in Israel and Palestine based on 45 interviews conducted between 2010 and 2018. The findings reveal that the projects mostly aim to create trust and understanding, but that activities related to an improvement of the environmental situation and to the cultivation of interdependence take place as well. Despite a number of significant problems \u2013 primarily the tense political situation and local resistance \u2013 the education activities successfully catalyse processes of building everyday or local peace, at least among the participants. An impact of such projects on formal conflict resolution is possible, but remains uncertain. The findings also show that environmental cooperation can spill-over and that contested processes of depoliticisation and neoliberalisation can, at least to a certain degree, be utilised to positively affect environmental cooperation, education and peacebuilding."

Most of research works focus on a limited set of users, characterized by the same kind of main activities, e.g., researchers, or exploit external knowledge, such as predefined ontologies. An heterogeneous environment, with possible lack of information, and not well structured data, puts forward new challenges, to address the problem of adapting user profiling and consequently expert search. In this paper, we present a first attempt to create an expert search system to support users (such as researchers, students, authors) in finding experts to get in contact or to start a cooperation with in the field of textbook research. Hereby we semantically enrich user profiles building a Community Knowledge Graph (CKG) which defines relationships among users and related items. Furthermore, we present first experimental results that base on real users."

                "abstract": "Recommender Systems refer to those applications that offer contents or items to the users, based on their previous activity. These systems are broadly used in several fields and applications, being common that an user interact with several recommender systems during his daily activities. However, most of these systems are black boxes which users really don\u2019t understand how to work. This lack of transparency often causes the distrust of the users. A suitable solution is to offer explanations to the user about why the system is offering such recommendations. This work deals with the problem of retrieving and evaluating explanations based on hybrid recommenders. These explanations are meant to improve the perceived recommendation quality from the user\u2019s perspective. Along with recommended items, explanations are presented to the user to underline the quality of the recommendation. Hybrid recommenders should express relevance by providing reasons speaking for a recommended item. In this work we present an attribute explanation retrieval approach to provide these reasons and show how to evaluate such approaches. Therefore, we set up an online user study where users were asked to provide movie feedback. For each rated movie we additionally retrieved feedback about the reasons this movie was liked or disliked. With this data, explanation retrieval can be studied in general, but it can also be used to evaluate such explanations."

                "abstract": "This article explores one challenge facing critical discourse studies (CDS) in today\u2019s mediatised world: the ontological and epistemological assumptions which prompt studies to analyse the construction of social orders (such as right-wing, racist or neoliberal orders) rather than the fissures and dislocations of these social orders. The former foregrounds stability, and the latter foregrounds instability. In this article, I first sketch postfoundational thinking, arguing that this thinking brings breakdown, disruption and instability to the centre of attention. Although postfoundational thought is most prominently associated with a particular set of thinkers (Nancy, Lefort, Laclau and Ranci\u00e8re), I also include approaches often omitted from current discussions (Lather, Haraway, Malabou and Sedgwick). Second, I consider three central concepts in CDS from a postfoundational perspective: critique, rationality and validity. Critique is conceptualised as a generative criticality which addresses unequal power relations through (fine-grained) analysis of hope-giving, reparative discourse which is oriented to well-being. Rationality is positioned as mobile, contingent, political and positioned, rather than universal and non-subjective. Validity is separated from understandings of objectivity and bias and associated instead with surprise and transgressive validities. Finally, two brief examples illustrate how postfoundational approaches to discourse have engaged with reframing social movements and democracy and rethinking what counts as the economy. "

Globalization is understood in this approach as referring to: (1) a cognitive shift; (2) expanding relevancy spaces; and (3) new forms of subjectivation. The framework is illustrated with examples from educational policy and learning materials, with an extended look at how globalization is articulated in recent shifts in Holocaust education."

The chapters offer an array of theoretical and empirical instruments for revealing, identifying, sifting, weighing and connecting patterns of language use that construct messages. These messages carry with them world views and value systems that can either create an ever wider divide or serve to build bridges between peoples and countries.The Editorial Board includes: Paul Baker (Lancaster), Frantisek Cermak (Prague), Susan Conrad (Portland), Geoffrey Leech (Lancaster), Dominique Maingueneau (Paris XII), Christian Mair (Freiburg), Alan Partington (Bologna), Elena Tognini-Bonelli (Lecce and TWC), Ruth Wodak (Lancaster and Vienna), and Feng Zhiwei (Beijing). \"The Corpus and Discourse\" series consists of two strands. The first, Research in Corpus and Discourse, features innovative contributions to various aspects of corpus linguistics and a wide range of applications, from language technology via the teaching of a second language to a history of mentalities. The second strand, Studies in Corpus and Discourse, is comprised of key texts bridging the gap between social studies and linguistics. Although equally academically rigorous, this strand will be aimed at a wider audience of academics and postgraduate students working in both disciplines.

It explores history education as a media- saturated cultural site in which particular social orderings and categorizations emerge as commonsensical and others are contested. Describing vignettes from ethnographic fieldwork in German secondary schools, this article identifies different memory practices as a nexus of pupils, teachers, blackboards, pens, textbooks, and online videos that enacts what counts as worth remembering today: reproduction; destabilization without explicit contestation; and interruption. Exploring mediated memory practices thus highlights an array of (often unintended) ways of making the past present.<br/>"

                "abstract": "How self-evident is a colonial rationality today? This paper begins by tracing a \u2018text trajectory\u2019 about nineteenth century imperialism and colonialism through several educational spaces: curricular guidelines, textbook, teachers\u2019 reflections on history education, material discursive classroom interactions and pupils\u2019 communication about the topic. In a first step, we observe how entrenched and common sensical a great-power discourse about imperialism and colonialism is in current educational practices. We suggest that pupils \u2018hyperstate\u2019 a discursive position on colonialism which appears shocking when stated explicitly, but which is already subtly entextualised in curricular and media discourse. However, in a second step, the analysis orients to the molecular lines and foldings, the unexpected intra-connections and unplanned \u2018lines of flight\u2019. In this way, the apparent stability of the colonial rationality begins to wobble (just slightly). The memory practices enacted by pupils, curricula, teachers, authors and the material affordances of textbooks repeat entrenched colonial hierarchies and racisms, \u2018and also\u2019 exceed any overly simple understanding of how colonial rationality plays out in contemporary discourse.<br/><br/>"

                "abstract": "This article explores the contribution of the concept of \u2018minimal politics\u2019 to understanding contemporary blogging. Politics is often used to refer only to state actions or to very rare ruptures to existing formations; citizens\u2019 and social media are often only considered successful if they influence political leaders or lead to radical social change. The perspective adopted in this article, drawing on theories of agonistic democracy and hegemony, foregrounds the apparently quotidian ways in which current formations are destabilized. To explore the smallest radically democratic practices of contesting what appears to be a current hegemonic formation, the article analyses blog coverage of the publication in Germany of Thilo Sarrazin\u2019s book Deutschland schafft sich ab. The book, celebrated by some sections of the media and population, argued that the genetic transmission of intelligence and the high number of Muslim immigrants in Germany was leading to the demise of the country. Analysis identified three strategies utilized by blogs to contest the Sarrazin case: rebutting, reflecting, re-articulating. The political aspect of blogging, it is argued, should not be reduced to moments of rupture or moments of consensus, but also encompass the practices of tearing apparently tiny fissures in current media/social constellations."

Es zeichnet nach, wie Schulb\u00fccher und andere curriculare Materialien f\u00fcr Geschichte, Politik und Wirtschaft produziert, Entscheidungen gef\u00e4llt wurden und welche Menschen und andere nicht-menschliche Akteure involviert waren. Eine Reflektion, wie digitale Technologien die Zukunft des Lernens gestalten, ist inkludiert. Die eingebetteten Fallbeispiele sprechen thematisieren umfassende Diskurse \u00fcber Demokratie, Gender, globale Hierarchien, Rassismus, Ethik, Zuf\u00e4lligkeit, Kritik und das unternehmerische Selbst. Nach einem \u00dcberblick der Literatur \u00fcber Bildungspublikation, zieht der Beitrag Fallbeispiele heran, um acht Praktiken aufzulisten, die eine Rolle beim Selektieren von Inhalten spielen: (1) Marktorientierung, (2) Wissensdelegation, (3) prozedurale Autorisierung, (4) p\u00e4dagogische Ziele, (5) wissenschaftliche Genauigkeit, (6) ethische Angemessenheit, (7) intendierte Lesende/Nutzende und (8) diskursive Echos. Abschlie\u00dfend werden die Dynamiken vom Wandel in der Bildungsver\u00f6ffentlichung angesichts der wechselnden, unstabilen, unaufger\u00e4umten, materiell diskursiven Verstrickungen des Feldes besprochen.

First, it summarises the theories, methods and substantive issues which the preceding chapters in the Handbook identify as leading the field of textbook studies today. Second, again in close dialogue with the Handbook\u2019s other chapters and their findings, it points to extant gaps in the research. Third, reflecting critically on the Handbook\u2019s structural limitations, it identifies topics and issues to which future textbook research could devote itself beyond the foci presented in its chapters. The chapter concludes that textbook studies has evolved into an interdisciplinary field of research which has succeeded in applying, modifying and further developing theories and methods from the social sciences and cultural studies."

Drawing on cultural studies, media theory and socio-material analysis, it suggests that textbooks can be seen as material elements within larger assemblages. An increasing interest in the \u2018mediality\u2019 of textbooks refers to a shift in focus from the content and information presented in media such as textbooks to the \u2018how\u2019 of their mediation, that is, to the ways in which words, images and materiality are choreographed into ways of engaging with these media. The chapter describes three methodological and theoretical approaches to mediality: (1) the linguistic dimension, (2) the multimodal dimension, and (3) the material dimension. It also points to areas for further research, focusing on interdisciplinary dialogue, non-coherence and digital (im)materiality."

                "abstract": "As digital data become increasingly central to education, hopes for educational equity are pinned more strongly on educational technology providers. This paper examines the data practices of edtech providers who are not simply making token gestures towards justice and equality. Drawing on ethnographic interviews and Berlant\u2019s notion of cruel optimism, it presents three data stories. The paper suggests that datafication in education provides a showcase of cruel optimism, i.e., when the object of desire is blocking one\u2019s flourishing. The conclusion considers the constitutive paradoxes of datafied education, and implications for the current phase of edu-technical transformation."

                "abstract": "This paper presents a program for a university writing group, ran as a trial in Germany, that differs from common writing groups by allowing writers a high level of autonomy and choice. To theoretically frame this writing group model, we draw on the French philosopher Jacques Ranci\u00e8re and his presupposition of a radical equality of intelligence. Findings suggest that the use of these writing groups provide a foundation for students to experience academic writing in ways that are more playful, creative, and joyful, without feeling inferior and increasing students\u2019 awareness of their own intelligence, capacity and creativity. By coupling grounded analysis with theoretical reflections, and a set of questions to guide practice, this paper outlines how this program could be relevant for writing educators, curriculum developers, and other faculties in higher educational institutions across global contexts."

Drawing on ethnographically oriented research at German Schools Abroad, this paper teases out three sets of practices regarding young  people\u2019s  mobile  media  use:  \u00absafe\u00bb,  \u00abenthusiastic\u00bb,  and  \u00abpostdigital\u00bb.  Presenting  vignettes  from  three  schools  to  illustrate  each  set  of  practices,  the  paper  demonstrates  how  students  are  differently  controlled,  guided,  and  given  space  to  shape  their  worlds  through  the  practices.  The  paper  highlights  that  these  practices  exist  simultaneously.  <br/>They enact different (not better or worse) institutional priorities and different (not better or  worse)  understandings  of  young  people\u2019s  mobile  use.  The  paper  also  highlights  the  tensions  when  schools  aim  to  control  young  people\u2019s  mobile  use,  arguing  that  each  set  of practices undermines itself. It ends by reflecting on the implications for future research and  practice  if  we  see  increased  mobile  media  use  in  schools  not,  as  often  assumed,  <br/>as  a  mark  of  \u00abprogress\u00bb,  \u00abimprovement\u00bb  or  \u00abmodernity\u00bb,  but  instead  as  emerging  from  different understandings of school and young people"

Among the most important technologies emerging today are data-aggregating technologies such as AI, affective computing, adaptive or predictive software, clouds and platforms. The paper is not, however, directed at specific technologies, but at indeterminate sociotechnical configurations. Set in 2040, it offers three \u2018histories\u2019 of the 2020s. Might students become (i) \u2018smooth users\u2019, improving themselves in the pursuit of frictionless efficiency within a post-democratic frame created by large corporations, (ii) \u2018digital nomads\u2019, seeking freedom, individualism and aesthetic joy as solopreneurs exploiting state regulations and algorithmic rules while stepping out of the state and deeply into the capitalist new economy, or (iii) participatory, democratic, ecological humans embedded in \u2018collective agency\u2019 that see institutions as spaces for exploring more equitable ways of living? The paper reflects on the future research and the political, educational and technological decisions which would make each of these three fictional future histories more or less likely."

It explores history education as a media- saturated cultural site in which particular social orderings and categorizations emerge as commonsensical and others are contested. Describing vignettes from ethnographic fieldwork in German secondary schools, this article identifies different memory practices as a nexus of pupils, teachers, blackboards, pens, textbooks, and online videos that enacts what counts as worth remembering today: reproduction; destabilization without explicit contestation; and interruption. Exploring mediated memory practices thus highlights an array of (often unintended) ways of making the past present.<br/>"

This paper begins by tracing a \u2018text trajectory\u2019 about nineteenth century imperialism and colonialism through several educational spaces: curricular guidelines, textbook, teachers\u2019 reflections on history education, material discursive classroom interactions and pupils\u2019 communication about the topic. In a first step, we observe how entrenched and common sensical a great-power discourse about imperialism and colonialism is in current educational practices. We suggest that pupils \u2018hyperstate\u2019 a discursive position on colonialism which appears shocking when stated explicitly, but which is already subtly entextualised in curricular and media discourse. However, in a second step, the analysis orients to the molecular lines and foldings, the unexpected intra-connections and unplanned \u2018lines of flight\u2019. In this way, the apparent stability of the colonial rationality begins to wobble (just slightly). The memory practices enacted by pupils, curricula, teachers, authors and the material affordances of textbooks repeat entrenched colonial hierarchies and racisms, \u2018and also\u2019 exceed any overly simple understanding of how colonial rationality plays out in contemporary discourse.<br/><br/>"

Rather, as media and objects of memory politics, they are part of a societal negotiation process to determine relevant knowledge. Changes made to textbooks in relation to this controversial topic take place in very short periods of time and often go beyond what appears to meet with mutual agreement in the political sphere."

This chapter provides an overview of textbook analyses on this subject published in the last two decades, to the end of identifying trends and pinpointing gaps in the research. Extant studies approach textbooks from perspectives relating to the Self and the Other or to memory studies or via the concept of knowledge. Many of them focus on European colonialism of the nineteenth century, with history textbooks predominating as objects of analysis. I will argue that there is a need to overcome these specific preoccupations and carry out a greater number of systematically proceeding comparative studies. Further approaches with potential for future research include taking the visual elements of textbooks into consideration in analysis and conducting comparative analyses of textbooks and other media."

First, it summarises the theories, methods and substantive issues which the preceding chapters in the Handbook identify as leading the field of textbook studies today. Second, again in close dialogue with the Handbook\u2019s other chapters and their findings, it points to extant gaps in the research. Third, reflecting critically on the Handbook\u2019s structural limitations, it identifies topics and issues to which future textbook research could devote itself beyond the foci presented in its chapters. The chapter concludes that textbook studies has evolved into an interdisciplinary field of research which has succeeded in applying, modifying and further developing theories and methods from the social sciences and cultural studies."

We thus see a process of the discursive \u2018invisibling\u2019 of textbook authors both in their works themselves and in textbook research. This \u2018invisibling\u2019 of textbook authors affects their author function in relation to textbooks as an object and medium. Yet promising current research seeks to identify ways in which textbook authors exercise their author function and how they simultaneously interact with a range of other actors and networks. This permits the examination of various processes of change in the production of educational media for schools and of the effects of these processes on authors and on the specific practices by which they exercise their authorship."

It explores history education as a media- saturated cultural site in which particular social orderings and categorizations emerge as commonsensical and others are contested. Describing vignettes from ethnographic fieldwork in German secondary schools, this article identifies different memory practices as a nexus of pupils, teachers, blackboards, pens, textbooks, and online videos that enacts what counts as worth remembering today: reproduction; destabilization without explicit contestation; and interruption. Exploring mediated memory practices thus highlights an array of (often unintended) ways of making the past present.<br/>"

                "abstract": "How self-evident is a colonial rationality today? This paper begins by tracing a \u2018text trajectory\u2019 about nineteenth century imperialism and colonialism through several educational spaces: curricular guidelines, textbook, teachers\u2019 reflections on history education, material discursive classroom interactions and pupils\u2019 communication about the topic. In a first step, we observe how entrenched and common sensical a great-power discourse about imperialism and colonialism is in current educational practices. We suggest that pupils \u2018hyperstate\u2019 a discursive position on colonialism which appears shocking when stated explicitly, but which is already subtly entextualised in curricular and media discourse. However, in a second step, the analysis orients to the molecular lines and foldings, the unexpected intra-connections and unplanned \u2018lines of flight\u2019. In this way, the apparent stability of the colonial rationality begins to wobble (just slightly). The memory practices enacted by pupils, curricula, teachers, authors and the material affordances of textbooks repeat entrenched colonial hierarchies and racisms, \u2018and also\u2019 exceed any overly simple understanding of how colonial rationality plays out in contemporary discourse.<br/><br/>"

First, it summarises the theories, methods and substantive issues which the preceding chapters in the Handbook identify as leading the field of textbook studies today. Second, again in close dialogue with the Handbook\u2019s other chapters and their findings, it points to extant gaps in the research. Third, reflecting critically on the Handbook\u2019s structural limitations, it identifies topics and issues to which future textbook research could devote itself beyond the foci presented in its chapters. The chapter concludes that textbook studies has evolved into an interdisciplinary field of research which has succeeded in applying, modifying and further developing theories and methods from the social sciences and cultural studies."

It has held this position unrivalled until the very recent emergence, commencing around the turn of the millennium, of its first radical challenge in the shape of digitalisation and the novel possibilities for the transmission of knowledge it presents. Historically, textbooks have long been subject to control exercised through education policy by and on behalf of societal elites, a control emerging through competition among specialist subject disciplines and education science, which together define the canon of knowledge to be taught in each school subject. This said, textbooks have responded to profound changes in society\u2019s ideas of childhood and adolescence by developing target group-specific products which have harnessed aesthetic and technical innovations."

For this purpose, the GEI provides research infrastructures such as its renowned research library and various dedicated digital information services. Hence, the institute develops and manages both digital and social research infrastructures. As such, the GEI realizes a unique position in the international field of textbook research. In the digital humanities (DH), the investigation of research questions is supported by a range of increasingly sophisticated digital methods such as automatic image and text analysis, linguistic text annotation, or data visualization. Digital tools and services combined with the increasing amount of resources available through digital libraries such as the German Digital Library, the Deutsches Textarchiv, Europeana and research infrastructures such as CLARIN or DARIAH provide digital support for textbook analysis. In this work, we present the actual state of the art of the development of digital infrastructures for digital humanities in international textbook research. "

                "abstract": "Recommender Systems refer to those applications that offer contents or items to the users, based on their previous activity. These systems are broadly used in several fields and applications, being common that an user interact with several recommender systems during his daily activities. However, most of these systems are black boxes which users really don\u2019t understand how to work. This lack of transparency often causes the distrust of the users. A suitable solution is to offer explanations to the user about why the system is offering such recommendations. This work deals with the problem of retrieving and evaluating explanations based on hybrid recommenders. These explanations are meant to improve the perceived recommendation quality from the user\u2019s perspective. Along with recommended items, explanations are presented to the user to underline the quality of the recommendation. Hybrid recommenders should express relevance by providing reasons speaking for a recommended item. In this work we present an attribute explanation retrieval approach to provide these reasons and show how to evaluate such approaches. Therefore, we set up an online user study where users were asked to provide movie feedback. For each rated movie we additionally retrieved feedback about the reasons this movie was liked or disliked. With this data, explanation retrieval can be studied in general, but it can also be used to evaluate such explanations."

Many different approaches have been successfully evaluated on English or Chinese texts. Nevertheless the assumption that these algorithms equally perform on all other languages cannot be verified yet. It is our intention to encourage more research in other languages, making a start with German. Therefore, this work introduces a German corpus for subjectivity detection on German news articles. We carry out this study in which we choose a number of state of the art subjectivity detection approaches and implement them. Finally we show and compare these algorithms\u2019 performances and give advice on how to use and extend the introduced dataset."

While this work takes place across various academic disciplines and in relation to textbooks for diverse school subjects, the chapter primarily discusses the field of religious studies and German-language textbook analysis. The chapter highlights the following tendencies and trends: First, while older textbook research explores accurate or inaccurate depictions of a specific faith, more recent work prioritises the depiction of religious diversity in textbooks. Second, most textbook analyses focus on theories and methods, although some new studies draw their rationale from political interests such as promoting democracy. Finally, evident research gaps include differentiation within religions, the intersectional nature of religion and society, boundary drawing between religion and \u2018non-religion,\u2019 and digital humanities-related issues."

Denn neben die christliche Religion und ihre Konfessionen sind in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten zunehmend sowohl andere \"Weltreligionen\" als auch neue Formen von Religion getreten. Viele Menschen ziehen sich aus religi\u00f6sen Strukturen zur\u00fcck, zugleich konstatiert die Religionsforschung in einer Art Korrektur des seit den 1970er Jahren dominanten S\u00e4kularisierungsparadigmas ein Wiederaufleben religionsorientierter Legitimations- und Argumentationsmuster in verschiedenen gesellschaftlichen Bereichen. Die Aktivit\u00e4ten religi\u00f6ser Institutionen diversifizieren sich,[1] und Religion wird mehr und mehr zur Sache von Einzelnen"

                "abstract": "Inspired by World Society scholarship, I use examples from the Romanian educational sphere to examine Europeanization in relation with worldwide developments. Instead of seeing Europeanization broadly as the process of becoming more \u2018European\u2019 (an approach that encounters the difficulty of defining \u2018Europe\u2019), or narrowly as a process of \u2018EU-ization\u2019 (an approach that suffers from EU-centric blindness to the rest of the world), I propose to define Europeanization as a process of institutionalization of world culture that is particularly visible in post-socialist contexts characterized by an emergence from relative totalitarian isolation. The main finding presented here is an increasing cosmopolitanization of the nation emerging from the way in which the category \u2018Europe\u2019 permeates schooled content: the nation is tamed down through discursive association with Europe (a significant other) rather than through elimination or discreditation. By expressing educational scripts that legitimize it as a nation-state in the post-1945 redefined sense of the term, Romania's compulsory education displays signs of becoming more like the rest of the world rather than more like \u2018Europe\u2019.

                "abstract": "Through an investigation of policy documents and reports from post-1989 Romanian education reform, this article argues that what came to be known in the early 1990s as a \u2018post-socialist condition\u2019, characterized by exuberant nationalism, needs to be rethought. Rather than an exceptional path, Romanian education displays conspicuous synchronization with wider world trends, while some peculiar national narratives in explaining reform failures persist. Instead of becoming more nation-focused (as predicted by prevalent conceptualizations of \u2018Eastern\u2019 types of nationalism), discourses of educational reform opened up to the world, most notably through the mediation of Europe. Since the end of the nationalizing decade of the 1990s, educational texts have consistently invoked global themes of adaptation. Narratives about the mission of mass education and reform priorities encapsulating officially-sanctioned projections of the nation became outwardlooking, in contrast to the self-referential rhetoric of socialist times. The changing patterns of Romanian nation-building are reflective of trends across the world, pointing to a reconsideration of the exceptionalism often associated with Eastern Europe."

The findings suggest a complex picture of change combining liberal, communitarian and cosmopolitan renditions of the new citizen, all having a common thread: the shift towards a post-national ethos delinking the citizen from the exclusive purchase of national belonging and decoupling citizen action from the absolute duty to the patria. Such significant changes are often overlooked due to the dominant focus on the failures to comply with an idealized Western liberal model. However, they invite us to reconsider current understandings of both the pitfalls and the opportunities of post-socialist citizenship education by considering them from a different angle: that of wider socio-cultural change that is gradually being institutionalised at the world level."

Drawing from fieldwork data collected in the multicultural district of Cluj, I focus on diversity as an aspect of Europeanization of schooling in Romania. My findings reveal that Europeanization works symbolically rather than substantially in educational establishments enrolling a multi-ethnic student body. Although diversity is embraced discursively by teachers and staff, school practices fail to demonstrate an incorporation of diversity into the Romanian national narrative which remains marked by the old structures of ethnocentric monoculturalism and self-victimization. Explanatory factors brought into discussion refer to institutional continuity (i.e. the persistence of old habits in everyday school practices) and institutional contradiction (i.e. the coexistence of the distinctive logics of multiculturalism as difference and of integration as social justice in the delivery of educational policy for Hungarian and Roma minorities)."

Yet, the French public discourse and policy instruments concerned with ethnic and racial diversities evolved in sharp contrast to those in the United States. Whereas U.S. nation-building incorporated the recognition of ethnoracial identities, with all of its trials and tribulations, the French nation's trajectory assumed a unitary form. Recent developments, however, point to changes in the Republic's projection of its identity and its citizenry. An analysis of school teaching finds that the Republic is now re-envisioned as open and tolerant of diversity, though more from a universalistic, normative perspective\u2014increasingly indexed at the transnational level\u2014than from a perspective that privileges France's immigrant and colonial past."

It focuses on the extent to which the educational systems have synchronized with the European direction towards multiculturalism and de-nationalizing trends, and on the Romanian history curriculum and textbook changes after the fall of communism, which have still not reached the formally acknowledged and desired standards. In order to sustain this argument, I empirically delineate the differences between the social construction of identity in national history textbooks in the communist and the post-communist periods by analyzing the content of two high-school history textbooks from a diachronic comparative perspective. The main empirical focus of the content analysis is the implicit and explicit construction of nationhood, which is identified by scrutinizing events, actors and causal attributions within the national narrative presentation. The findings reveal important changes in the formal regulations and application of educational reform in history textbooks, but nevertheless point to implementation difficulties pertaining to deeper national- value and attitudinal features that continue to permeate text production. By finding that history textbooks still fail to accommodate the \u2018European\u2019 trend at the level of the national historical narrative, policy makers in education could acknowledge and implement a more thorough harmonization between educational, curricular and textbook reform in contemporary, new EU-member, Romania."

By drawing on policy documentation, interviews with key players, qualitative data from everyday school contexts, and extensive textbook analysis, this groundbreaking study explores change within the Romanian education system as a process that institutionalises world culture through symbolic mediation of the concept \u2018Europe\u2019. The book argues that the education system\u2019s structural and organisational evolution through time is decoupled from its self-depiction by ultimately serving a nation-building agenda. It does so despite notable changes in the discourse reflecting increasingly transnational definitions of the mission of the school in the post-1989 era. The book also suggests that the notions of \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018citizen\u2019 institutionalised by the school are gradually being redefined as cosmopolitan, matching post-war patterns of post-national affiliations on a worldwide level."

The chapter first reviews the key thematic clusters, research questions, and geographic areas addressed in this field of study. It then presents dominant theoretical and methodological choices, to finally move to key findings and debates that structure current preoccupations with transnational identities and values in textbook research. An evaluation of the current state of research and suggestions for future directions are given at the end."

They present a broad working definition of the reading primer as an educational medium that lends itself to interdisciplinary research which takes into account aspects such as visual and textual content, materiality, and societal contexts of production, distribution and usage. The editors further highlight characteristics of current research into primers and argue in favor of more comparative approaches that reveal transnational dimensions of textbooks designed to teach children how to read and write."

Despite a significant number of studies exploring how the legacy of the Third Reich should be taught and remembered, and the increasing amount of literature on understanding and preventing right-wing extremism in Germany, the scholarly landscape is rather scant when it comes to the relationship between right-wing extremism (that goes beyond the Nazis) and history education today. Our study fills in this gap by conducting an analysis of national policies, curricula and textbooks of history education across the 16 federal states. Through an interdisciplinary lens, our aim is to not only provide a snapshot of how this topic is intended to be taught in schools but also bring to the fore the political context, dynamics and policies within which these decisions are made. This approach also enables us to determine the interconnections between the three levels - federal policies, state curricula and textbooks- and ascertain for example, the degree to which there are variances between these levels. Our findings point toward a mismatch between discourses found in textbooks and contemporary debates, a dissonance we argue has potentially adverse implications"

In this chapter we address<br/>the question of how could \u2018going beyond container-logic\u2019 work in educational<br/>research practice. We argue that to achieve this shift we need to first disentangle<br/>varieties of transnational agendas into empirical, theoretical and methodological<br/>forms (Levitt/Khagram 2008)and understand their relationships. Working reflexively<br/>with \u2018methodological\u2019 forms of transnational agendas and avoiding their pitfalls<br/>means to reveal key assumptions and reconstruct them again by changing the<br/>way we approach research in the first place. In other words, we argue that researching<br/>the transnational in education (\u2018empirical transnationalism\u2019) is better served if<br/>we simultaneously transnationalize our research practices (\u2018methodological transnationalism\u2019).<br/>We suggest two practical strategies that could be useful in educational<br/>science: (1) addressing the research design and (2) changing data collection and<br/>interpretation practices in a multi-researcher team. Following this, we illustrate<br/>what kind of results we generate through this transnational lens based on examples<br/>from a multi-sited research project on global citizenship education in German<br/>Schools Abroad.

Covering a broad range of cultural contexts and applying a diverse set of methodological strategies, they map the dividing lines in and between memory cultures in the crisis-driven and volatile age of our present in which mnemonic consensus is clearly an issue of the past \u2013 if indeed it has ever existed at all. Authors analysing educational media point to varying degrees of ambivalence, vagueness and contradictions in the inescapably political textbook narratives understood to be echoes of societal and academic controversies. Authors focussing on teachers and the history classroom show how unresolved political issues create tensions and dilemmas in history education. They render visible how teachers struggle to handle these challenges by pretending that what they do is \u2018just history\u2019. Obfuscating the political that is inherent to all memory practices, they produce the illusion that the history in which they are engaged is all about addressing the past with a reflexive and disciplined approach."

Die Argumentation folgt dabei einem Dreischritt mit Blick auf Diskurs, Institution und Praktiken: Zun\u00e4chst diskutieren wir, was Teilen in der Debatte \u00fcber OER bedeutet und welche gesellschaftspolitischen Forderungen mit dem Verst\u00e4ndnis <br/>einer Kultur des Teilens verkn\u00fcpft sind. Dann beschreiben wir aus schultheoretischer Perspektive die Funktionen der Institution Schule und identifizieren dabei das Leistungs- und das Gemeinschaftsprinzip als analytische Linsen. Diese dienen uns im dritten Schritt zur Untersuchung  von  Praktiken  des  Teilens  im  Klassenraum  am  Beispiel  einer  Unterrichtsbeobachtung.  Als  Ergebnis  arbeiten  wir  heraus,  dass  das  Verst\u00e4ndnis  des  Begriffes  \u2039Teilen\u203a in der Schule und im OER-Diskurs trotz inhaltlicher \u00dcberschneidungen differiert. Die sich daraus ergebenden Spannungen sind zum einen Erkl\u00e4rung daf\u00fcr, warum OER in der Schule aktuell wenig verwendet werden und bieten gleichzeitig Handlungsimplikationen f\u00fcr  Bildungspraxis  und  -politik.  Der  Beitrag  endet  mit  einer  Einladung  zu  weiterer  OER-Forschung und schl\u00e4gt den entwickelten Dreischritt als theoretischen Bezugsrahmen hierf\u00fcr vor."

Im Zentrum des Projektes steht \u00bbOberschlesien\u00ab \u2013 einerseits als Gegenstand einer erinnerungspolitischen Untersuchung, andererseits als Schauplatz virulenter bildungspolitischer Entwicklungen, die symbolisch in das erstmalig erscheinende Geschichtsbuch zur Regionalkunde Oberschlesiens einflie\u00dfen. Ziel der Studie ist, der bildungspolitischen Debatte in Polen wie Deutschland eine verl\u00e4ssliche Basis zu geben, um (auch) deutsches Kulturerbe als Europ\u00e4isierungsmoment der oberschlesischen Geschichte zu begreifen. Weiter will sie andeuten, wie Oberschlesien als ein multikulturell gepr\u00e4gter Erinnerungsort im Unterricht erfolgreich vermittelt werden kann. "

Die wohl weitreichendste Z\u00e4sur stellten die Verschiebung der nationalstaatlichen Grenzen und der nahezu vollst\u00e4ndige Austausch der Bev\u00f6lkerung im Gefolge des Zweiten Weltkriegs dar. In j\u00fcngster Zeit dient der Umgang mit der Vergangenheit als wichtige Ressource f\u00fcr die Suche nach regionaler Identit\u00e4t in Polen, Litauen und Russland. F\u00fcr das Medium Schulbuch ist die vorliegende Studie in einem internationalen Vergleich \u00fcber das 20.

In order to determine the significance of regions for textbook research, two fundamental questions must be addressed: What are the different kinds of textbooks available to investigate representations of \u2018region\u2019? And which approaches from more general academic discourse have existing textbook analyses applied so far? In principle, a broad plurality of methods exists with which to investigate the representation of \u2018region.\u2019 However, as this chapter will show, the selection of a particular sample and theoretical framework is often linked to the preferred use of certain methodological approaches in textbook research."

                "abstract": "In addition to serving as an introduction to the subject, this paper suggests a conceptual framework for the investigation of issues of classification and quantification related to migration and the ethnically and religiously diverse societies in Europe. Nationality, ethnicity and religion are situational, contextual and dynamic social phenomena which tend to defy rigid classification, making it especially difficult to capture and quantify these entities in order to organize and represent them in an intelligible manner in official statistics (e.g. censuses), institutional governing practices or in academic survey research. By drawing on previous work by demographers and social researchers, we suggest a typological classification of ways in which diverse populations become statistically visible or invisible. We show that the rationale for creating classifications and particular sets of categories changes, depending on the political field in which data are used in the governance of populations and migration. A science studies perspective can make these diverse taxonomies the object of studies to understand how they are embedded within, and how they sustain, power relations. By focusing on practices of classification as instruments of research and governance, this special issue contributes to a reflection on the conditions and effects of quantifying practices in culturally diverse and constantly changing societies, in which the line between government and academia, between power and knowledge, is frequently indistinct.<br/>"

Although changing history textbooks towards a more inclusive and pluralistic narrative is arguably a necessary step for a sustainable peace, efforts to do so have met with strong resistance and ultimately failed. Existing studies have illuminated the problematic historical content of these textbooks and often point towards the controversies raised, but rarely do they offer an in-depth analysis of these discourses about textbooks. This study seeks to fill this gap by deconstructing these \u2018discourses of resistance\u2019 to reach a deeper understanding of why this aspect of peacebuilding has failed. Empirical findings through an analysis of interviews, policy documents, newspapers, speeches and circulars indicate a pronounced link between education and security, which has until recently remained at the periphery of peacebuilding research. Discourses of resistance present changes to history textbooks as a betrayal and threat to the nationalist struggle, a process I argue constitutes the securitisation of history textbooks."

                "abstract": "The recent rise of far-right populism and right wing extremism in Germany has forced a rethinking of the ways in which history education addresses the past and prepares young people for being active democratic citizens. Despite a significant number of studies exploring how the legacy of the Third Reich should be taught and remembered, and the increasing amount of literature on understanding and preventing right-wing extremism in Germany, the scholarly landscape is rather scant when it comes to the relationship between right-wing extremism (that goes beyond the Nazis) and history education today. Our study fills in this gap by conducting an analysis of national policies, curricula and textbooks of history education across the 16 federal states. Through an interdisciplinary lens, our aim is to not only provide a snapshot of how this topic is intended to be taught in schools but also bring to the fore the political context, dynamics and policies within which these decisions are made. This approach also enables us to determine the interconnections between the three levels - federal policies, state curricula and textbooks- and ascertain for example, the degree to which there are variances between these levels. Our findings point toward a mismatch between discourses found in textbooks and contemporary debates, a dissonance we argue has potentially adverse implications"

We conducted in-depth fieldwork in one German school in a long-term project from 2012 to 2017. We present theoretically and empirically based research from classroom observation and teacher interviews that informs debates about open education and innovative digital media pedagogies. The feature embeds the project\u2019s findings in a reflection on digital practices in schools and, more broadly, in the contemporary global debate over the implementation of digital media in schools."

Nach einem \u00dcberblick zu Problemstellung, theoretischen Bez\u00fcgen und Methodik des Projekts werden ausgew\u00e4hlte Ergebnisse aus drei thematischen Bereichen vorgestellt. Anhand einer Fallanalyse wird erstens verfolgt, wie sich lokalpolitische Ordnungen nach der R\u00fcckkehr von neotraditionalen H\u00e4uptlingen rekonfigurieren. Zweitens werden Befunde zur Frage vorgestellt, wie sich zur\u00fcckgekehrte Funktion\u00e4rInnen der UNITA, die den B\u00fcrgerkrieg verlor, in der angolanischen Nachkriegsgesellschaft positionieren und wie dies mit Interpretationen ihres eigenen Mobilit\u00e4tsverlaufs und der lokalpolitischen Situation im Nachkriegsangola zusammenh\u00e4ngt. Drittens schlie\u00dflich wird diskutiert, welche Einfl\u00fcsse der edukatorischen Projekte in Fl\u00fcchtlingslagern auf die angolanische R\u00fcckkehrgesellschaft zu beobachten sind und wie es zu systematischen Blockaden des Transfers von westlichen Werten und Praktiken kommt, die das internationale Fl\u00fcchtlingsregime zu vermitteln und bis in die Herkunftsl\u00e4nder zu verbreiten sucht."

Therefore, the challenge is to create a bridge between Linked Open Data (LOD) and the Component MetaData Infrastructure (CMDI) to ensure that the limits of the two paradigms are compensated and strengthened to create a new hybrid approach. While on the one hand, CMDI is easier to use for modelling purposes, the Metadata is not descriptive enough for a document to be easily discoverable using Linked Data (LD) technologies to publish and to enrich the document\u2019s content. Yet on the other hand, the explicit semantics and high interoperability of LOD have many advantages, but its modelling process is too complex for non-expert users. Here we show how knowledge organization plays a crucial role in this issue."

Interoperability between heterogeneous resources and services is the key for a properly functioning infrastructure. In this paper, we present a digital infrastructure of our textbook-related services and data, which are available and open for researchers worldwide. In this process we adhere to established standards and provide APIs for other services. In order to integrate our resources and tools into the CLARIN infrastructure and make them discoverable in the VLO (Virtual Language Observatory), we decided to use CMDI (Component MetaData Infrastructure). We focus in this paper on the creation process for a CMDI metadata profile which fulfils the needs of our projects."

                "abstract": "The principles of open data and the five-star model allow companies to develop low-cost services and Public Administrations (PA) to improve efficiency. However, the process of implementing open data models and principles is not easy unless it is supported by an appropriate technology platform. Today there is a huge number of technological platforms which each promise to be the ideal solution for opening data. Current solutions (commercial or free) do not provide users with easy access to data, nor tools for analysing and displaying data. In this paper, we discuss the potential of the DAF (Data Analytics Framework), a project based on big data, which was created by the Italian government in 2017 and which fosters the integration and standardisation of data, as well as providing three powerful tools for analysis and data visualisation. The paper will then illustrate a concrete case of dashboard development within the DAF, released at an important hackathon organised by the Italian PA sector in October 2017. The project serves as a use case in DAF implementation, where its analytical tools are used for data analysis &amp; visualisation. They also translate a large amount of data into simple representations and use clear and effective language. "

                "abstract": "In our society we are continually invested by a stream of information (opinions, preferences, comments, etc.). This shows how Twitter users react to news or events that they attend or take part in real time and with interest. In this context it becomes essential to have the appropriate tools in order to be able to analyze and extract data and information hidden in their large number of tweets. Social networks are a source of information with no rivals in terms of amount and variety of information that can be extracted from them. We propose an approach to analyze, with the help of automated tools, comments and opinions taken from social media in a real time environment. We developed a software system in R based on the Bayesian approach for text categorization."

Descriptive metadata characterise a resource with keyword-value pairs. The use of such descriptions allows researchers clearer and easier access to available resources. In this way, users can manage and find research data beyond traditional publications. The Georg Eckert Institute (GEI) creates and curates various digital resources that are offered to the community of international textbook research and other scientific field. This paper discusses how to provide a CMDI (Component MetaData Infrastructure) profile for our textbooks, in order to integrate them into CLARIN infrastructure and thus open them make them <br/>fairer. After adapting to CMDI profile for research project data, we now look into the creation of a new profile for the digitized historical  textbooks  of  \"GEI-Digital\".

Covering a broad range of cultural contexts and applying a diverse set of methodological strategies, they map the dividing lines in and between memory cultures in the crisis-driven and volatile age of our present in which mnemonic consensus is clearly an issue of the past \u2013 if indeed it has ever existed at all. Authors analysing educational media point to varying degrees of ambivalence, vagueness and contradictions in the inescapably political textbook narratives understood to be echoes of societal and academic controversies. Authors focussing on teachers and the history classroom show how unresolved political issues create tensions and dilemmas in history education. They render visible how teachers struggle to handle these challenges by pretending that what they do is \u2018just history\u2019. Obfuscating the political that is inherent to all memory practices, they produce the illusion that the history in which they are engaged is all about addressing the past with a reflexive and disciplined approach."

By drawing on policy documentation, interviews with key players, qualitative data from everyday school contexts, and extensive textbook analysis, this groundbreaking study explores change within the Romanian education system as a process that institutionalises world culture through symbolic mediation of the concept \u2018Europe\u2019. The book argues that the education system\u2019s structural and organisational evolution through time is decoupled from its self-depiction by ultimately serving a nation-building agenda. It does so despite notable changes in the discourse reflecting increasingly transnational definitions of the mission of the school in the post-1989 era. The book also suggests that the notions of \u2018nation\u2019 and \u2018citizen\u2019 institutionalised by the school are gradually being redefined as cosmopolitan, matching post-war patterns of post-national affiliations on a worldwide level."

It has long been established that history textbooks play a key role in shaping the next generation\u2019s understanding of both past events and the concept of \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018foe\u2019. Considering both current and historical textbooks, often through a bi-national comparative approach, the editors and contributors investigate various important aspects of the relationships between textbooks and war, including the role wars play in the creation of national identities (whether the country is on the winning or losing side), the effacement of international wars to highlight a country\u2019s exceptionalism, or the obscuring of intra-national conflict through the ways in which a civil war is portrayed. This pioneering book will be of interest and value to students and scholars of textbooks, educational media and the relationships between curricula and war."

Being one of the symbols of community identity, women are in fact at the core of the intricate network of socio-political and identity strategies that govern the relationships between the various souls of  Israeli society, between the  Jewish majority and the Palestinian minority. Various issues intertwine in the volume: the relationship between Islam, secularism and modernity; the debate on Islam and women's rights; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; the condition of Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. While focusing on law, the research aims at capturing historical and political interactions in the peculiar Israeli environment, also through interviews with leading figures of the Palestinian community in Israel: Sharia judges, social workers, political representatives and women's rights activists."

Over the years, many CBIR systems have been proposed to give a solution for an efficient use of multimedia/visual contents and other issues as performance, quality of retrieval, data heterogeneity, and multimodal information integration. The aim of the proposed approach is to prove that the use of geographic data can improve the results obtained by an image matching system based only on visual data. Our framework is composed of three parts, each of them described in detail in this paper: the first part is dedicated to CBIR, with an experimental comparison of a large number of different multimedia features to choose the one to use in the system implementation; in the second part the methodology to integrate geographic and multimedia data is showed; in the last part is presented a GIR system implementation using a \u201cpoints of interest\u201d search. An Android application has been developed for the client-side using Apache Solr as server side provider for the information retrieval functionalities. An experimental evaluation is carried out to demonstrate the effective improvement given by the combination of geographic and multimedia data. Our results have been obtained using a real dataset composed of artworks located in Naples\u2019s museums."

                "abstract": "The daily use of mobile devices and the expansion of the world-wide-web lead multimedia information to an uncontrolled growth. In this context, the use of smart interfaces and the combination of different features in the information retrieval process are crucial aspects. In particular, for a cultural heritage application it is important to consider that a digitized artwork is only a representation of a real object, represented under specific conditions (camera position, brightness, etc.). These issues could be causes of alterations during the features extraction task. In this paper we propose a multimodal approach for cultural heritage information retrieval combining geographic and visual data. Our approach has been implemented in a mobile system based on open source technologies. It is composed of three main parts related to image matching functionalities, Geographic Information Retrieval task, and a combination strategy for multimedia and geographic data integration. An Android application has been developed to give a user friendly interface and a case study together with some experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach for the user satisfaction."

Legal question answering systems have the potential to alleviate this task by automatically retrieving relevant legal texts for a specific statement and checking whether the meaning of the statement can be inferred from the found documents. We investigate a combination of the BM25 scoring method of Elasticsearch with word embeddings trained on English translations of the German and Japanese civil law. For this, we define criteria which select a dynamic number of relevant documents according to threshold scores. Exploiting two deep learning classifiers and their respective prediction bias with a threshold-based answer inclusion criterion has shown to be beneficial for the textual entailment task, when compared to the baseline.

                "abstract": "This article examines Austrian, British, French and German newsreels and European information films produced in the period from 1948 to 1958 either by private and semi-private newsreel companies or transnational, supranational and national institutions like the Economic Cooperation Administration, Council of Europe, European Coal and Steel Community. These newsreel items and short films are not only records from the beginning and consolidation of the European integration project but also political instruments in this process. On the one hand, they informed the public about the new institutions, their purposes as well as their decision-making procedures; on the other hand, they were intended to create a European identity by rewriting a collective cultural and historical memory. By means of these films, some of them being part of the public relations campaigns of various European institutions and newsreel companies, a consistent picture of \u2018Europe\u2019 was shaped. This audiovisual representation of Europe as a geographical and historical entity, or, respectively, \u2018the idea of European integration\u2019, was not only a result of a political discourse but also a cultural continuation of a centuries-old iconographic tradition. This article aims at broadening the academic debate on a European identity by analysing the political communication process of the European Integration in the 1950s."

The so-called spatial turn within the social sciences and humanities has exposed transnational, postcolonial and global aspects of identity constructions beyond the narrow borders of the nation and all things national. Stimulating historical and geographical research into nations and identities, this journal is informed by the same epistemology, tentatively located in postmodern thinking. Despite the prophecies of doom of postmodern enthusiasts, this study testifies to the continued relevance of borders and national attachments, albeit in terms of self-reflexivity."

                "abstract": "Biofuels have been the subject of heated political discussions, but also of a growing literature on discourses and environmental policies. Previous studies on the issue have, however, neglected the fact that the different discourses about on biofuels are increasingly crossing national boundaries, i.e., that there is a tendency toward transnationalization. In the light of this development the present article analyzes the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse in the period 2005-2011 with a special emphasis on actors from Brazil, the EU and the USA. By conducting a discourse analysis along the lines of Hajer, five discourse coalitions can be distinguished, each providing a different view on the opportunities, problems and perspectives of biofuel production in Brazil. It is observed that the long-established hegemony of the discourse coalition of biofuel supporters was successfully challenged by a more critical position during the food crisis of 2007/2008. As a result, the discourse coalition of critical supporters-which was committed to sustainable biofuel production via political regulation-prevailed in the transnational Brazilian biofuel discourse and its position was translated into policy measures."

The challenge focused on three context-aware recommendation scenarios: time-based, mood-based, and social recommendation. The participants were provided with anonymized datasets from two real-world online movie recommendation communities and competed against each other for obtaining the highest accuracy of recommendations. The datasets contained contextual features, such as tags, annotation, social relationsips, and comments, normally not available in public recommendation datasets. More than 40 teams from 21 countries participated in the challenge. Their participation was summarized by 10 papers published by the workshop, which have been extended and revised for the current special issue. In this preface we overview the challenge datasets, tasks, evaluation metrics, and the obtained outcomes."

The system utilizes a set of context-aware, hybrid, and other collaborative filtering solutions in order to generate various recommendations from which its users can pick those corresponding best to their current situation (i.e. context). All user interaction is fed back to the system in order to additionally improve the quality of the recommendations. Additionally, users can explicitly ask the system to treat certain recommenders as more important than others, or disregard them completely if the list of recommended movies is not to their liking."

However, as new movies are added, and new users join movie recommendation services, the problem of recommending suitable items becomes increasingly harder. In this paper, we present a simple way of using a priori movie data in order to improve the accuracy of collaborative filtering recommender systems. The approach decreases the sparsity of the rating matrix by inferring personal ratings on tags assigned to movies. The new tag ratings are used to find which movies to recommend. Experiments performed on data from the movie recommendation community Moviepilot show a positive effect on the quality of recommended items."

Most of research works focus on a limited set of users, characterized by the same kind of main activities, e.g., researchers, or exploit external knowledge, such as predefined ontologies. An heterogeneous environment, with possible lack of information, and not well structured data, puts forward new challenges, to address the problem of adapting user profiling and consequently expert search. In this paper, we present a first attempt to create an expert search system to support users (such as researchers, students, authors) in finding experts to get in contact or to start a cooperation with in the field of textbook research. Hereby we semantically enrich user profiles building a Community Knowledge Graph (CKG) which defines relationships among users and related items. Furthermore, we present first experimental results that base on real users."

However, teaching and learning in European schools still seem to follow conventional patterns. This study asks how contemporary European education policies and curricula frame digital learning in schools, with particular attention to history education. It investigates digital strategies, media education concepts, core curricula, and history and IT-related curricula, which collectively shape the requirements, guidelines and expectations for the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in history lessons. In addition to analysing European Union policy, the study includes case studies of seven European countries (Albania, Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain)."

Die wohl weitreichendste Z\u00e4sur stellten die Verschiebung der nationalstaatlichen Grenzen und der nahezu vollst\u00e4ndige Austausch der Bev\u00f6lkerung im Gefolge des Zweiten Weltkriegs dar. In j\u00fcngster Zeit dient der Umgang mit der Vergangenheit als wichtige Ressource f\u00fcr die Suche nach regionaler Identit\u00e4t in Polen, Litauen und Russland. F\u00fcr das Medium Schulbuch ist die vorliegende Studie in einem internationalen Vergleich \u00fcber das 20. Jahrhundert hinweg bis zur Gegenwart erstmals Narrativen und Repr\u00e4sentationen der Region nachgegangen, systematisch geb\u00fcndelt in der Analyse von mental maps und sieben zentralen Topoi: die Pruzzen, Grunwald/Tannenberg/\u017dalgiris, Migration, Konfessionen, Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft und Landschaft.

                "abstract": "Recommender Systems refer to those applications that offer contents or items to the users, based on their previous activity. These systems are broadly used in several fields and applications, being common that an user interact with several recommender systems during his daily activities. However, most of these systems are black boxes which users really don\u2019t understand how to work. This lack of transparency often causes the distrust of the users. A suitable solution is to offer explanations to the user about why the system is offering such recommendations. This work deals with the problem of retrieving and evaluating explanations based on hybrid recommenders. These explanations are meant to improve the perceived recommendation quality from the user\u2019s perspective. Along with recommended items, explanations are presented to the user to underline the quality of the recommendation. Hybrid recommenders should express relevance by providing reasons speaking for a recommended item. In this work we present an attribute explanation retrieval approach to provide these reasons and show how to evaluate such approaches. Therefore, we set up an online user study where users were asked to provide movie feedback. For each rated movie we additionally retrieved feedback about the reasons this movie was liked or disliked. With this data, explanation retrieval can be studied in general, but it can also be used to evaluate such explanations."

                "abstract": "A lot of information that is already available on the Web, or retrieved from local information systems and social networks is structured in data silos that are not semantically related. Semantic technologies make it emerge that the use of typed links that directly express their relations are an advantage for every application that can reuse the incorporated knowledge about the data. For this reason, data integration, through reengineering (e.g. triplify), or querying (e.g. D2R) is an important task in order to make information available for everyone. Thus, in order to build a semantic map of the data, we need knowledge about data items itself and the relation between heterogeneous data items. In this paper, we present our work of providing Lexical Linked Data (LLD) through a meta-model that contains all the resources and gives the possibility to retrieve and navigate them from different perspectives. We combine the existing work done on knowledge domains (based on the Information Coding Classification) within the Multilingual Lexical Linked Data Cloud (based on the RDF/OWL EurowordNet and the related integrated lexical resources (MultiWordNet, EuroWordNet, MEMODATA Lexicon, Hamburg Methaphor DB)."

                "abstract": "Adequate fresh water availability is an important factor for human security in many parts of the world. In transboundary river basins, decreased water supply due to local environmental change and global climate change and increased water demand due to growing populations and continued economic development can aggravate water scarcity. Contrary to the claim that water scarcity may result in an increased risk of armed conflict, there is no simple relationship between freshwater availability and violent conflict. Other crucial factors need to be taken into consideration that also directly influence resource availability and personal human well\u2010being. In this review, we assess the scientific literature on conflict and cooperation in transboundary river systems. Most international river basins are already jointly managed by the riparians, but successful management in times of climate change necessitates the inclusion of more factors besides mere allocation schemes. On the basis of a substantial body of literature on the management of transboundary watersheds, an analytical framework of the water\u2010security nexus is developed that integrates the physical and socioeconomic pathways connecting water availability with conflict or cooperation. This framework is subsequently applied to two transboundary river basins\u2014the Nile River and the Syr Darya/Amu Darya\u2014as they represent two world regions that could become future water hot spots. An improved understanding of the developments leading to water conflicts and their interaction can help to successfully reduce the risk of water conflicts in these regions and to move toward increased cooperation among the riparians of transboundary river systems"

                "abstract": "Adequate fresh water availability is an important factor for human security in many parts of the world. In transboundary river basins, decreased water supply due to local environmental change and global climate change and increased water demand due to growing populations and continued economic development can aggravate water scarcity. Contrary to the claim that water scarcity may result in an increased risk of armed conflict, there is no simple relationship between freshwater availability and violent conflict. Other crucial factors need to be taken into consideration that also directly influence resource availability and personal human well\u2010being. In this review, we assess the scientific literature on conflict and cooperation in transboundary river systems. Most international river basins are already jointly managed by the riparians, but successful management in times of climate change necessitates the inclusion of more factors besides mere allocation schemes. On the basis of a substantial body of literature on the management of transboundary watersheds, an analytical framework of the water\u2010security nexus is developed that integrates the physical and socioeconomic pathways connecting water availability with conflict or cooperation. This framework is subsequently applied to two transboundary river basins\u2014the Nile River and the Syr Darya/Amu Darya\u2014as they represent two world regions that could become future water hot spots. An improved understanding of the developments leading to water conflicts and their interaction can help to successfully reduce the risk of water conflicts in these regions and to move toward increased cooperation among the riparians of transboundary river systems"

                "abstract": "This article contributes to the literature on securitization in a twofold way. Firstly, it argues that school textbooks reveal the consolidated discursive realms of a given society and convey them to the next generation. Focusing on school textbooks can thus enrich the analysis of facilitating conditions for securitization processes. The second and main contribution of this article is that it addresses the lack of empirical studies on the audience in securitization research. After an analysis of climate change discourses in Germany, we test whether students exposed to vastly different positions of the same consolidated discursive realm are more prone to accept the securitization of climate change. In order to do so, we use a quasi-experimental research design and a closed questionnaire. Results show that young people who read school textbooks using an alarmist logic are indeed more likely to conceive climate change as an urgent threat necessitating extraordinary measures, and are thus more likely to accept the securitization of climate change."

                "abstract": "Critics have argued that the evidence of an association between climate change and conflict is flawed because the research relies on a dependent variable sampling strategy. Similarly, it has been hypothesized that convenience of access biases the sample of cases studied (\u2018streetlight effect\u2019). This also gives rise to claims that the climate-conflict literature stigmatizes some places as being more \u2018naturally\u2019 violent. Yet there has been no proof of such sampling patterns. Here we test whether climate-conflict research is based on such a biased sample through a systematic review of the literature. We demonstrate that research on climate change and violent conflict suffers from a streetlight effect. Further, small-N studies in particular are strongly informed by cases where there has been conflict, do not sample on the independent variables (climate impact or risk), and hence tend to find some association between these two variables. These biases mean that research on climate change and conflict primarily focuses on a few well accessible regions, overstates the links between both phenomena, and cannot explain peaceful outcomes from climate change. This could result in maladaptive responses in those places that are stigmatized as being inherently more prone to climate-induced violence."

                "abstract": "This article contributes to the literature on securitization in a twofold way. Firstly, it argues that school textbooks reveal the consolidated discursive realms of a given society and convey them to the next generation. Focusing on school textbooks can thus enrich the analysis of facilitating conditions for securitization processes. The second and main contribution of this article is that it addresses the lack of empirical studies on the audience in securitization research. After an analysis of climate change discourses in Germany, we test whether students exposed to vastly different positions of the same consolidated discursive realm are more prone to accept the securitization of climate change. In order to do so, we use a quasi-experimental research design and a closed questionnaire. Results show that young people who read school textbooks using an alarmist logic are indeed more likely to conceive climate change as an urgent threat necessitating extraordinary measures, and are thus more likely to accept the securitization of climate change."

However, resilience has rarely been applied in conjunction with the potentially complementary concept of environmental security. Therefore, this paper explores how the concepts of resilience and environmental security can be jointly applied by non-governmental organizations working to implement peacebuilding projects in developing countries. We first review definitions of the concepts and explore their strengths and pitfalls. Second, we develop a conceptual framework for a joint application whereby environmental security sharpens the scope of resilience, while resilience allows for taking issues into account that a traditional environmental security perspective might miss. Finally, we apply the conceptual framework to a case study from Palestine."

Yet, the French public discourse and policy instruments concerned with ethnic and racial diversities evolved in sharp contrast to those in the United States. Whereas U.S. nation-building incorporated the recognition of ethnoracial identities, with all of its trials and tribulations, the French nation's trajectory assumed a unitary form. Recent developments, however, point to changes in the Republic's projection of its identity and its citizenry. An analysis of school teaching finds that the Republic is now re-envisioned as open and tolerant of diversity, though more from a universalistic, normative perspective\u2014increasingly indexed at the transnational level\u2014than from a perspective that privileges France's immigrant and colonial past."

                "abstract": "This book provides rich descriptions of practices of remembering the socially disputed period of the Cold War in history textbooks, in the narratives of history teachers and in the social space of the history classroom. Covering a broad range of cultural contexts and applying a diverse set of methodological strategies, they map the dividing lines in and between memory cultures in the crisis-driven and volatile age of our present in which mnemonic consensus is clearly an issue of the past \u2013 if indeed it has ever existed at all. Authors analysing educational media point to varying degrees of ambivalence, vagueness and contradictions in the inescapably political textbook narratives understood to be echoes of societal and academic controversies. Authors focussing on teachers and the history classroom show how unresolved political issues create tensions and dilemmas in history education. They render visible how teachers struggle to handle these challenges by pretending that what they do is \u2018just history\u2019. Obfuscating the political that is inherent to all memory practices, they produce the illusion that the history in which they are engaged is all about addressing the past with a reflexive and disciplined approach."

The 15th conference in this series, held at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, focused on knowledge organization for the digital humanities. Structuring, and interacting with, large data collections has become a major issue in the digital humanities. In these proceedings, various aspects of knowledge organization in the digital humanities are discussed, and the authors of the papers show how projects in the digital humanities deal with knowledge organization."

The guest editors show how reading primers published and used around the end of the Second World War in several European countries may serve as an object of study in different disciplinary contexts. They present a broad working definition of the reading primer as an educational medium that lends itself to interdisciplinary research which takes into account aspects such as visual and textual content, materiality, and societal contexts of production, distribution and usage. The editors further highlight characteristics of current research into primers and argue in favor of more comparative approaches that reveal transnational dimensions of textbooks designed to teach children how to read and write."

                "abstract": "This article explores the contribution of the concept of \u2018minimal politics\u2019 to understanding contemporary blogging. Politics is often used to refer only to state actions or to very rare ruptures to existing formations; citizens\u2019 and social media are often only considered successful if they influence political leaders or lead to radical social change. The perspective adopted in this article, drawing on theories of agonistic democracy and hegemony, foregrounds the apparently quotidian ways in which current formations are destabilized. To explore the smallest radically democratic practices of contesting what appears to be a current hegemonic formation, the article analyses blog coverage of the publication in Germany of Thilo Sarrazin\u2019s book Deutschland schafft sich ab. The book, celebrated by some sections of the media and population, argued that the genetic transmission of intelligence and the high number of Muslim immigrants in Germany was leading to the demise of the country. Analysis identified three strategies utilized by blogs to contest the Sarrazin case: rebutting, reflecting, re-articulating. The political aspect of blogging, it is argued, should not be reduced to moments of rupture or moments of consensus, but also encompass the practices of tearing apparently tiny fissures in current media/social constellations."

                "abstract": "This paper presents a program for a university writing group, ran as a trial in Germany, that differs from common writing groups by allowing writers a high level of autonomy and choice. To theoretically frame this writing group model, we draw on the French philosopher Jacques Ranci\u00e8re and his presupposition of a radical equality of intelligence. Findings suggest that the use of these writing groups provide a foundation for students to experience academic writing in ways that are more playful, creative, and joyful, without feeling inferior and increasing students\u2019 awareness of their own intelligence, capacity and creativity. By coupling grounded analysis with theoretical reflections, and a set of questions to guide practice, this paper outlines how this program could be relevant for writing educators, curriculum developers, and other faculties in higher educational institutions across global contexts."

                "abstract": "While calls to transcend methodological nationalism are hardly new in the social<br/>sciences, responding to them in education remains abstract and largely un-substantiated<br/>by research on schools and schooling processes. In this chapter we address<br/>the question of how could \u2018going beyond container-logic\u2019 work in educational<br/>research practice. We argue that to achieve this shift we need to first disentangle<br/>varieties of transnational agendas into empirical, theoretical and methodological<br/>forms (Levitt/Khagram 2008)and understand their relationships. Working reflexively<br/>with \u2018methodological\u2019 forms of transnational agendas and avoiding their pitfalls<br/>means to reveal key assumptions and reconstruct them again by changing the<br/>way we approach research in the first place. In other words, we argue that researching<br/>the transnational in education (\u2018empirical transnationalism\u2019) is better served if<br/>we simultaneously transnationalize our research practices (\u2018methodological transnationalism\u2019).<br/>We suggest two practical strategies that could be useful in educational<br/>science: (1) addressing the research design and (2) changing data collection and<br/>interpretation practices in a multi-researcher team. Following this, we illustrate<br/>what kind of results we generate through this transnational lens based on examples<br/>from a multi-sited research project on global citizenship education in German<br/>Schools Abroad. Finally, we reflect on open questions concerning a methodologically<br/>transnational research agenda."

The 15th conference in this series, held at Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, focused on knowledge organization for the digital humanities. Structuring, and interacting with, large data collections has become a major issue in the digital humanities. In these proceedings, various aspects of knowledge organization in the digital humanities are discussed, and the authors of the papers show how projects in the digital humanities deal with knowledge organization."

Among the most important technologies emerging today are data-aggregating technologies such as AI, affective computing, adaptive or predictive software, clouds and platforms. The paper is not, however, directed at specific technologies, but at indeterminate sociotechnical configurations. Set in 2040, it offers three \u2018histories\u2019 of the 2020s. Might students become (i) \u2018smooth users\u2019, improving themselves in the pursuit of frictionless efficiency within a post-democratic frame created by large corporations, (ii) \u2018digital nomads\u2019, seeking freedom, individualism and aesthetic joy as solopreneurs exploiting state regulations and algorithmic rules while stepping out of the state and deeply into the capitalist new economy, or (iii) participatory, democratic, ecological humans embedded in \u2018collective agency\u2019 that see institutions as spaces for exploring more equitable ways of living? The paper reflects on the future research and the political, educational and technological decisions which would make each of these three fictional future histories more or less likely."

For textbooks, as educational media and carriers of cultures of memory, this state of disagreement amounts to both a challenge and an opportunity to reflect societal debates around the issue. In their overview of current work on the depiction of socialism in textbooks, the authors uncover the theoretical assumptions and methodological approaches underlying this research and point the reader towards innovative work which ventures beyond simple analysis of textbooks\u2019 shortcomings in this regard. This chapter reveals a preponderance of research on Germany and post-Soviet countries and casts light on the heterogeneity of the theoretical premises and findings of work in this area."

                "abstract": "Critics have argued that the evidence of an association between climate change and conflict is flawed because the research relies on a dependent variable sampling strategy. Similarly, it has been hypothesized that convenience of access biases the sample of cases studied (\u2018streetlight effect\u2019). This also gives rise to claims that the climate-conflict literature stigmatizes some places as being more \u2018naturally\u2019 violent. Yet there has been no proof of such sampling patterns. Here we test whether climate-conflict research is based on such a biased sample through a systematic review of the literature. We demonstrate that research on climate change and violent conflict suffers from a streetlight effect. Further, small-N studies in particular are strongly informed by cases where there has been conflict, do not sample on the independent variables (climate impact or risk), and hence tend to find some association between these two variables. These biases mean that research on climate change and conflict primarily focuses on a few well accessible regions, overstates the links between both phenomena, and cannot explain peaceful outcomes from climate change. This could result in maladaptive responses in those places that are stigmatized as being inherently more prone to climate-induced violence."

                "title": "Sampling Bias in Climate-Conflict Research",
                "abstract": "Critics have argued that the evidence of an association between climate change and conflict is flawed because the research relies on a dependent variable sampling strategy. Similarly, it has been hypothesized that convenience of access biases the sample of cases studied (\u2018streetlight effect\u2019). This also gives rise to claims that the climate-conflict literature stigmatizes some places as being more \u2018naturally\u2019 violent. Yet there has been no proof of such sampling patterns. Here we test whether climate-conflict research is based on such a biased sample through a systematic review of the literature. We demonstrate that research on climate change and violent conflict suffers from a streetlight effect. Further, small-N studies in particular are strongly informed by cases where there has been conflict, do not sample on the independent variables (climate impact or risk), and hence tend to find some association between these two variables. These biases mean that research on climate change and conflict primarily focuses on a few well accessible regions, overstates the links between both phenomena, and cannot explain peaceful outcomes from climate change. This could result in maladaptive responses in those places that are stigmatized as being inherently more prone to climate-induced violence."

It has long been established that history textbooks play a key role in shaping the next generation\u2019s understanding of both past events and the concept of \u2018friend\u2019 and \u2018foe\u2019. Considering both current and historical textbooks, often through a bi-national comparative approach, the editors and contributors investigate various important aspects of the relationships between textbooks and war, including the role wars play in the creation of national identities (whether the country is on the winning or losing side), the effacement of international wars to highlight a country\u2019s exceptionalism, or the obscuring of intra-national conflict through the ways in which a civil war is portrayed. This pioneering book will be of interest and value to students and scholars of textbooks, educational media and the relationships between curricula and war."

                "abstract": "The principles of open data and the five-star model allow companies to develop low-cost services and Public Administrations (PA) to improve efficiency. However, the process of implementing open data models and principles is not easy unless it is supported by an appropriate technology platform. Today there is a huge number of technological platforms which each promise to be the ideal solution for opening data. Current solutions (commercial or free) do not provide users with easy access to data, nor tools for analysing and displaying data. In this paper, we discuss the potential of the DAF (Data Analytics Framework), a project based on big data, which was created by the Italian government in 2017 and which fosters the integration and standardisation of data, as well as providing three powerful tools for analysis and data visualisation. The paper will then illustrate a concrete case of dashboard development within the DAF, released at an important hackathon organised by the Italian PA sector in October 2017. The project serves as a use case in DAF implementation, where its analytical tools are used for data analysis &amp; visualisation. They also translate a large amount of data into simple representations and use clear and effective language. "

By contrast, there are almost no such studies for the domain of education. This void is crucial as school attendance rates and the prevalence of environmental education are on the rise, while school education has privileged access to young people during their political socialisation. We address this void by analysing the depiction of water conflicts in school textbooks from a critical geopolitics perspective. More specifically, we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to analyse the visual and textual content of German geography textbooks published between 2000 and 2017. Our findings reveal that the analysed school textbooks securitise water and overstate the risk of water conflicts, which could yield a range of negative societal effects. The textbooks further reproduce Orientalist stereotypes about the Global South, and about the Middle East in particular, and often promote an uncritical green economy stance towards the privatisation of water. Water conflicts are hence discussed in the context of a crisis discourse and reproduce powerful knowledge that privileges certain political interests at the expense of others."

                "abstract": "Policy makers across the entire globe have repetitively expressed concern about climate change as a trigger of mass migration and increased political instability. Recent research on both climate-conflict and climate-migration linkages has gained significant attention in the scientific and public debate. Both research fields are deeply intertwined and share some common characteristics. They also have been rapidly evolving during the past years with major achievements being made. Perhaps most importantly, an improved understanding of the role of (potential) climate change impacts in migration and conflicts has been achieved, which has been essential for moving beyond environmental determinism toward a more nuanced exploration of the interlinkages between climate, conflict and migration. Yet, significant conversations and uncertainties continue to exist, hence indicating the urgent need for further advances in these fields. Here, we debate cross-cutting and common pitfalls in both research fields and their implications for policy and research. These pitfalls include (i) insufficient attention to context factors and causal chains, (ii) underestimation of complex spatio-temporal patterns, (iii) discrepancies between quantitative and qualitative evidence, (iv) the non-consideration of adaptation strategies, and (v) a narrow spectrum of methods. We illustrate best practices and suggest ways to move the debate forward."

                "abstract": "Environmental peacebuilding has attracted great scholarly and political interest in recent years, but little knowledge is available on the interface of education and environmental peacebuilding. This void is unfortunate given the importance of education for peacebuilding and the wider \u201ceducational turn\u201d in human geography. This study represents the first systematic analysis of the role of education activities in the context of environmental peacebuilding. We establish a theoretical framework and analyse the education activities of three environmental peacebuilding projects in Israel and Palestine based on 45 interviews conducted between 2010 and 2018. The findings reveal that the projects mostly aim to create trust and understanding, but that activities related to an improvement of the environmental situation and to the cultivation of interdependence take place as well. Despite a number of significant problems \u2013 primarily the tense political situation and local resistance \u2013 the education activities successfully catalyse processes of building everyday or local peace, at least among the participants. An impact of such projects on formal conflict resolution is possible, but remains uncertain. The findings also show that environmental cooperation can spill-over and that contested processes of depoliticisation and neoliberalisation can, at least to a certain degree, be utilised to positively affect environmental cooperation, education and peacebuilding."

Furthermore, they discuss how well-known ontologies, such as FOAF, can be linked to their ontology and extend it. While the focus of the chapter is on semantic Collaboration Engineering, the authors additionally present methods of reasoning and machine learning to derive new knowledge about the collaboration process as a further research direction."

Users are also involved in a broad range of social activities like creating social relationships, recommending and sharing resources with friends, creating groups and communities, commenting friends activities and profiles and so on.

We assume that demographic information holds implicit information about users taste and interests, and present results of a simple method that extends standard collaborative filtering algorithms to include one or several of these features. We evaluate the our assumption in movie recommendation scenario and combine different features in order to improve recommendation results."

In this paper, we propose a Semantic Knowledge Management System that allows us to save knowledge in a semantic way and motivates employees to conserve their knowledge. To motivate people we intend to use concepts from the uprising field of Gamification and tailor them to enterprise needs mixed with concepts adapted from the Social Web. We also present ideas on how to use Linked Open Data as a source to enrich and enhance conserved knowledge. While many existing Knowledge Systems concentrate on the management and automatic creation process, our system strikes a new path to involve people in the knowledge creation process. Our goal is to produce semantified and more accurate results than existing solutions. This semantic knowledge is searchable, reusable and well structured and thus a great base for further usage."

In this paper we present ongoing research about a supporting framework for a semantic GSS that supports efficient collaborative work. Drawing on Collaboration Engineering, the paper explores the use of an ontology to capture and share process information that define the collaboration context. As a result, we present an approach of a collaboration ontology that subdivides the collaboration context into the individual context of a participant and the collaborative context of a group.

Current approaches for the named entity disambiguation are usually based on exploiting structured semantic and lingual re-sources (e.g. WordNet, DBpedia). Unfortu-nately, each of these resources cover indepen-dently from each other insufficient information for the task of named entity disambiguation. On the one hand WordNet comprises a relative small number of named entities while on the other hand DBpedia provides only little context for named entities. Our approach is based on the use of multi-lingual Wikipedia data. We show how the combination of multi-lingual resources can be used for named entity disambiguation. Based on a German and an English document corpus, we evaluate various similarity measures and algo-rithms for extracting data for named entity dis-ambiguation. We show that the intelligent filter-ing of context data and the combination of multi-lingual information provides high quality named entity disambiguation results."

We describe an implementation of our approach on a large-scale, real-life data stream of English and German newswire sources, and present an evaluation of the Named Entity Disambiguation module, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a German and an English evaluation dataset."

Expert discovery in public social networks such as Facebook faces the challenges of matching users to a wide range of expertise areas, because of the diverse human interests. In this paper we analyze the social graph and the user's interactions in the form of posts and group memberships to model user interests and fields of expertise. The proposed model reflects expertise and interests of users based on experimental analysis of the explicit and implicit social data in Online Social Networks (OSNs). It employs social networks analysis, text mining, text classification, and semantic text similarity techniques to analyze and discover the latent semantic social graph model that can express user's expertise. The proposed model also considers the semantic similarity between user's posts and his groups, Influence of friendship on group's membership, and Influence of friendship on user's posts. Experiments on the Facebook data show significant validity of the proposed model."

In this paper, we propose a Semantic Knowledge Management System that allows us to save knowledge in a semantic way and motivates employees to conserve their knowledge. To motivate people we intend to use concepts from the uprising field of Gamification and tailor them to enterprise needs mixed with concepts adapted from the Social Web. We also present ideas on how to use Linked Open Data as a source to enrich and enhance conserved knowledge. While many existing Knowledge Systems concentrate on the management and automatic creation process, our system strikes a new path to involve people in the knowledge creation process. Our goal is to produce semantified and more accurate results than existing solutions. This semantic knowledge is searchable, reusable and well structured and thus a great base for further usage."

Our approach reveals some of the structure of model summaries and identifies topics that are good approximations of the Summary Content Units (SCU) used in the Pyramid method. Our results show that the topic model identifies topic-sentence associations that correspond to the contributors of SCUs, suggesting that the topic modeling approach can generate a viable set of candidate SCUs for facilitating the creation of Pyramids.

In a graph, a link prediction function of two vertices denotes the similarity or proximity of the vertices. Common link prediction functions for general graphs are defined using paths of length two between two nodes. Since in a bipartite graph adjacency vertices can only be connected by paths of odd lengths, these functions do not apply to bipartite graphs. Instead, a certain class of graph kernels (spectral transformation kernels) can be generalized to bipartite graphs when the positive-semidefinite kernel constraint is relaxed. This generalization is realized by the odd component of the underlying spectral transformation. This construction leads to several new link prediction pseudokernels such as the matrix hyperbolic sine, which we examine for rating graphs, authorship graphs, folksonomies, document-feature networks and other types of bipartite networks.<br/>"

Classical methods of crawling data from SL lead to irrelevant data content because of the dynamic nature of avatars and objects in SL. In order to build artificially intelligent expert avatar agents that are able to provide intelligent services for other typical avatars in virtual world we attempt to en-hance the quality of extracted data from SL. Based on experimental observation, avatars tend to gather in some places for different amounts of time, which forms tempo-ral and spatial hotspots. Utilizing the Tempo-Spatial char-acteristics of the avatars behavior in virtual worlds could improve the quality of the extracted data. Smart-TSH-Finder implements a Tempo-Spatial Hotspots finding mechanism to crawl dynamic contents such as chat con-versations from Second Life. The system introduces two mechanisms: the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Detection, and the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Prediction. Our smart chat conversations that have been crawled showed good en-hancement in content quality of the crawled chat conver-sation which will enrich the future textual analysis work. Additionally, we found that extracting avatars interactions and behavior in the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots in addition to chat conversations can help in generation a more coherent social network model for SL."

Unfortu-nately, each of these resources cover indepen-dently from each other insufficient information for the task of named entity disambiguation. On the one hand WordNet comprises a relative small number of named entities while on the other hand DBpedia provides only little context for named entities. Our approach is based on the use of multi-lingual Wikipedia data. We show how the combination of multi-lingual resources can be used for named entity disambiguation.

However, there are many challenges to achieve these goals, such as finding experts that can interactively answer a given query, and matching the virtual and real identity of that given experts. In this paper, we study these issues and propose a framework for virtual e-learning solutions to integrate an expert avatar service to Virtual Worlde-learning environments to enrich those environments with one of the most important real learning futures, which is the ability to ask experts and get instant feedback. In our proposed solution, we implemented a web services based expert finding system for 3D virtual worlds to automatically identify the most qualified resident (expert avatar) to answer a given query. The nature of the proposed system as Web services architecture will increase scalability by allowing other virtual worlds to integrate with. Virtual e-learning environments will have great interest in the proposed solution, since it will on one hand improve the interactivity of users and on the other hand open opportunities to facilitate exchange of information between e-learning users.

                "abstract": "he Social Web, or the so called Web 2.0, is growing daily by the number of users and applications. In this way, a significant part of newly generated Web content and traffic is created by the users itself. They create, connect, comment, tag, rate, remix, upload, download, new or existing resources in an architecture of participation, where user contribution and interaction adds value. Users are also involved in a broad range of social activities like creating social relationships, recommending and sharing resources with friends, creating groups and communities, commenting friends activities and profiles and so on. But not only users benefit from the user-generated content, also social applications profit from that content by using it for personalization and adaptation to user needs."

However, as new movies are added, and new users join movie recommendation services, the problem of recommending suitable items becomes increasingly harder. In this paper, we present a simple way of using a priori movie data in order to improve the accuracy of collaborative filtering recommender systems. The approach decreases the sparsity of the rating matrix by inferring personal ratings on tags assigned to movies. The new tag ratings are used to find which movies to recommend. Experiments performed on data from the movie recommendation community Moviepilot show a positive effect on the quality of recommended items."

Many different approaches have been successfully evaluated on English or Chinese texts. Nevertheless the assumption that these algorithms equally perform on all other languages cannot be verified yet. It is our intention to encourage more research in other languages, making a start with German. Therefore, this work introduces a German corpus for subjectivity detection on German news articles. We carry out this study in which we choose a number of state of the art subjectivity detection approaches and implement them. Finally we show and compare these algorithms\u2019 performances and give advice on how to use and extend the introduced dataset."

Temporally evolving data brings a lot of new challenges to the data mining and machine learning community. This paper is concerned with the recognition of recurring patterns within multivariate time series, which capture the evolution of multiple parameters over a certain period of time.<br/>Our approach first separates a time series into segments that can be considered as situations, and then clusters the recognized segments into groups of similar context. The time series segmentation is established in a bottom-up manner according the correlation of the individual signals. Recognized segments are grouped in terms of statistical features using agglomerative hierarchical clustering.<br/><br/>The proposed approach is evaluated on the basis of real-life sensor data from different vehicles recorded during car drives. According to our evaluation it is feasible to recognize recurring patterns in time series by means of bottom-up segmentation and hierarchical clustering.<br/>"

Current approaches for the named entity disambiguation are usually based on exploiting structured semantic and lingual re-sources (e.g. WordNet, DBpedia). Unfortu-nately, each of these resources cover indepen-dently from each other insufficient information for the task of named entity disambiguation. On the one hand WordNet comprises a relative small number of named entities while on the other hand DBpedia provides only little context for named entities. Our approach is based on the use of multi-lingual Wikipedia data. We show how the combination of multi-lingual resources can be used for named entity disambiguation. Based on a German and an English document corpus, we evaluate various similarity measures and algo-rithms for extracting data for named entity dis-ambiguation. We show that the intelligent filter-ing of context data and the combination of multi-lingual information provides high quality named entity disambiguation results."

Expert discovery in public social networks such as Facebook faces the challenges of matching users to a wide range of expertise areas, because of the diverse human interests. In this paper we analyze the social graph and the user's interactions in the form of posts and group memberships to model user interests and fields of expertise. The proposed model reflects expertise and interests of users based on experimental analysis of the explicit and implicit social data in Online Social Networks (OSNs). It employs social networks analysis, text mining, text classification, and semantic text similarity techniques to analyze and discover the latent semantic social graph model that can express user's expertise. The proposed model also considers the semantic similarity between user's posts and his groups, Influence of friendship on group's membership, and Influence of friendship on user's posts. Experiments on the Facebook data show significant validity of the proposed model."

Classical methods of crawling data from SL lead to irrelevant data content because of the dynamic nature of avatars and objects in SL. In order to build artificially intelligent expert avatar agents that are able to provide intelligent services for other typical avatars in virtual world we attempt to en-hance the quality of extracted data from SL. Based on experimental observation, avatars tend to gather in some places for different amounts of time, which forms tempo-ral and spatial hotspots. Utilizing the Tempo-Spatial char-acteristics of the avatars behavior in virtual worlds could improve the quality of the extracted data. Smart-TSH-Finder implements a Tempo-Spatial Hotspots finding mechanism to crawl dynamic contents such as chat con-versations from Second Life. The system introduces two mechanisms: the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Detection, and the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Prediction. Our smart chat conversations that have been crawled showed good en-hancement in content quality of the crawled chat conver-sation which will enrich the future textual analysis work. Additionally, we found that extracting avatars interactions and behavior in the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots in addition to chat conversations can help in generation a more coherent social network model for SL."

To exploit these opportunities  e-learning  solutions need to utilize the virtual worlds\u2019 rich collaboration environment to offer enhanced and integrated real learning services combined with virtual e-learning services. However, there are many challenges to achieve these goals, such as finding experts that can interactively answer a given query, and matching the virtual and real identity of that given experts. In this paper, we study these issues and propose a framework for virtual e-learning solutions to integrate an expert avatar service to Virtual Worlde-learning environments to enrich those environments with one of the most important real learning futures, which is the ability to ask experts and get instant feedback. In our proposed solution, we implemented a web services based expert finding system for 3D virtual worlds to automatically identify the most qualified resident (expert avatar) to answer a given query. The nature of the proposed system as Web services architecture will increase scalability by allowing other virtual worlds to integrate with. Virtual e-learning environments will have great interest in the proposed solution, since it will on one hand improve the interactivity of users and on the other hand open opportunities to facilitate exchange of information between e-learning users.

To motivate people we intend to use concepts from the uprising field of Gamification and tailor them to enterprise needs mixed with concepts adapted from the Social Web. We also present ideas on how to use Linked Open Data as a source to enrich and enhance conserved knowledge. While many existing Knowledge Systems concentrate on the management and automatic creation process, our system strikes a new path to involve people in the knowledge creation process. Our goal is to produce semantified and more accurate results than existing solutions. This semantic knowledge is searchable, reusable and well structured and thus a great base for further usage."

In a graph, a link prediction function of two vertices denotes the similarity or proximity of the vertices. Common link prediction functions for general graphs are defined using paths of length two between two nodes. Since in a bipartite graph adjacency vertices can only be connected by paths of odd lengths, these functions do not apply to bipartite graphs. Instead, a certain class of graph kernels (spectral transformation kernels) can be generalized to bipartite graphs when the positive-semidefinite kernel constraint is relaxed. This generalization is realized by the odd component of the underlying spectral transformation. This construction leads to several new link prediction pseudokernels such as the matrix hyperbolic sine, which we examine for rating graphs, authorship graphs, folksonomies, document-feature networks and other types of bipartite networks.<br/>"

Classical methods of crawling data from SL lead to irrelevant data content because of the dynamic nature of avatars and objects in SL. In order to build artificially intelligent expert avatar agents that are able to provide intelligent services for other typical avatars in virtual world we attempt to en-hance the quality of extracted data from SL. Based on experimental observation, avatars tend to gather in some places for different amounts of time, which forms tempo-ral and spatial hotspots. Utilizing the Tempo-Spatial char-acteristics of the avatars behavior in virtual worlds could improve the quality of the extracted data. Smart-TSH-Finder implements a Tempo-Spatial Hotspots finding mechanism to crawl dynamic contents such as chat con-versations from Second Life. The system introduces two mechanisms: the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Detection, and the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots Prediction. Our smart chat conversations that have been crawled showed good en-hancement in content quality of the crawled chat conver-sation which will enrich the future textual analysis work. Additionally, we found that extracting avatars interactions and behavior in the Tempo-Spatial Hotspots in addition to chat conversations can help in generation a more coherent social network model for SL."

To exploit these opportunities  e-learning  solutions need to utilize the virtual worlds\u2019 rich collaboration environment to offer enhanced and integrated real learning services combined with virtual e-learning services. However, there are many challenges to achieve these goals, such as finding experts that can interactively answer a given query, and matching the virtual and real identity of that given experts. In this paper, we study these issues and propose a framework for virtual e-learning solutions to integrate an expert avatar service to Virtual Worlde-learning environments to enrich those environments with one of the most important real learning futures, which is the ability to ask experts and get instant feedback. In our proposed solution, we implemented a web services based expert finding system for 3D virtual worlds to automatically identify the most qualified resident (expert avatar) to answer a given query. The nature of the proposed system as Web services architecture will increase scalability by allowing other virtual worlds to integrate with. Virtual e-learning environments will have great interest in the proposed solution, since it will on one hand improve the interactivity of users and on the other hand open opportunities to facilitate exchange of information between e-learning users.

Drawing on Collaboration Engineering and the logical model, the paper explores the use of an ontology to capture and share knowledge about collaboration. As a result, we present a collaboration ontology that builds a common vocabulary for the key concepts of collaboration and the relations and dependencies between them. A generic GSS can use the ontology to enable knowledge exchange between experts and practitioners. This will increase the potential benefits of a GSS for collaboration."

                "abstract": "In this paper we present ongoing research about a supporting framework that improves Group Support Systems (GSS) for Collaboration Engineering (CE). CE uses a pattern design approach which allows groups with no design skills, and only limited facilitation skills, to design and execute efficient and effective collaboration processes. Our research tries to use Web-based GSS technologies to support the CE approach. We assume that Social and Semantic Web technologies could enhance CE providing relational (formal rules) and shared information (community experiences). This leads to a new GSS approach that supports groups in designing and executing a collaboration process considering users contributions for a structured collective knowledge sharing process."

First, the lexical database WordNet and its variants are presented. After a brief description of the Hamburg Metaphor Database, examples of its conversion into the RDF/OWL representation of EuroWordNet are discussed. The metaphor information is added to the general EuroWordNet data and the new resulting RDF/OWL structure is shown in LexiRes, a visualization tool developed and adapted for handling structures of ontological and lexical databases. We show how LexiRes can be used to further edit the newly added metaphor information, and explain some problems with this new type of information on the basis of examples."

Short words-, frequent wordsand n-gram-based approaches are considered and combined with the Ad-Hoc Ranking classification method. The language identification process can be subdivided into two main steps: First a document model is generated for the document and a language model for the language; second the language of the document is determined on the basis of the language model and is added to the document as additional information. In this work we present our evaluation results and discuss the importance of a dynamic value for the out-of-place measure."

Theoretically grounded in a sociological approach and empirically grounded in textual and visual thematic content analysis, the findings reveal significant semantic shifts in understandings of the \u201cnation\u201d in relation to internal and external anchors, including religion, monarchy, and work, but they also indicate important continuities relating to an ethos of political submission (toward God and king, or the party and the Soviet Union) and patriotic solidarity (with the Romanian Orthodox nation or the workers\u2019 proletarian nation)."

                "abstract": "In addition to serving as an introduction to the subject, this paper suggests a conceptual framework for the investigation of issues of classification and quantification related to migration and the ethnically and religiously diverse societies in Europe. Nationality, ethnicity and religion are situational, contextual and dynamic social phenomena which tend to defy rigid classification, making it especially difficult to capture and quantify these entities in order to organize and represent them in an intelligible manner in official statistics (e.g. censuses), institutional governing practices or in academic survey research. By drawing on previous work by demographers and social researchers, we suggest a typological classification of ways in which diverse populations become statistically visible or invisible. We show that the rationale for creating classifications and particular sets of categories changes, depending on the political field in which data are used in the governance of populations and migration. A science studies perspective can make these diverse taxonomies the object of studies to understand how they are embedded within, and how they sustain, power relations. By focusing on practices of classification as instruments of research and governance, this special issue contributes to a reflection on the conditions and effects of quantifying practices in culturally diverse and constantly changing societies, in which the line between government and academia, between power and knowledge, is frequently indistinct.<br/>"

                "abstract": "In this paper a system providing an efficient integration between Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) and Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) is presented. Over the years, many CBIR systems have been proposed to give a solution for an efficient use of multimedia/visual contents and other issues as performance, quality of retrieval, data heterogeneity, and multimodal information integration. The aim of the proposed approach is to prove that the use of geographic data can improve the results obtained by an image matching system based only on visual data. Our framework is composed of three parts, each of them described in detail in this paper: the first part is dedicated to CBIR, with an experimental comparison of a large number of different multimedia features to choose the one to use in the system implementation; in the second part the methodology to integrate geographic and multimedia data is showed; in the last part is presented a GIR system implementation using a \u201cpoints of interest\u201d search. An Android application has been developed for the client-side using Apache Solr as server side provider for the information retrieval functionalities. An experimental evaluation is carried out to demonstrate the effective improvement given by the combination of geographic and multimedia data. Our results have been obtained using a real dataset composed of artworks located in Naples\u2019s museums."

                "abstract": "The daily use of mobile devices and the expansion of the world-wide-web lead multimedia information to an uncontrolled growth. In this context, the use of smart interfaces and the combination of different features in the information retrieval process are crucial aspects. In particular, for a cultural heritage application it is important to consider that a digitized artwork is only a representation of a real object, represented under specific conditions (camera position, brightness, etc.). These issues could be causes of alterations during the features extraction task. In this paper we propose a multimodal approach for cultural heritage information retrieval combining geographic and visual data. Our approach has been implemented in a mobile system based on open source technologies. It is composed of three main parts related to image matching functionalities, Geographic Information Retrieval task, and a combination strategy for multimedia and geographic data integration. An Android application has been developed to give a user friendly interface and a case study together with some experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach for the user satisfaction."
